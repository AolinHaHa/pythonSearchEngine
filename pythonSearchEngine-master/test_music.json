But people with open minds could find there's some beautiful melodies and harmonies as well as lively, upbeat tunes that are a joy to put on. I find the Memory of Trees to be one of her most consistent albums; plus it helps it has probably one of my top 5 favorite songs ever.The Memory of Trees: Like all of her records (except the recent Amarantine), the albums open with a wordless instrumental and this album's title track is probably my favorite with gentle piano arpeggios and a beautiful vocal track. I always like the sparse use of percussion. 9/10Anywhere Is: The lively single; it's actually a good sing-along with staccato beats and a great chorus. It's also a perfect length since it's under 3 minutes so whereas some pop songs drag after awhile, this one hooks you in then lets you go, leaving you wanting more. 9/10Pax Deorum: Another album, another ominous Latin-sung piece. The music sounds like something you'd hear in enemy territories in video games while Enya gives a low-voice, almost monotone performance over the music. Slightly repetitive until a 2nd higher voice comes in but the piece hits its stride halfway with a gorgeous bridge. 8/10Athair Ar Nearmh: There's some songs she does where it's more about the song itself rather than a poppy, catchy quality a la Only Time and this song's similar. Another ballad with some of her best singing, it's a more low-key track but it's also one of the album highlights. 8.5/10From Where I Am: Another instrumental; this one's a more piano-based piece that would be a nice song to learn for all pianists out there since it's not technically complex or fast but it's pleasant to listen to. 7.5/10China Roses: There's only a handful of songs I could have on repeat and never get sick of them and this is one of them. Everything from the vocals and background instrumentation, the lyrics and not to mention one of the most relaxing and almost tranquil ending codas I've ever heard, this is definately my favorite song on here, plus her whole career even. 15/10Hope Has a Place: For me, any song after China Roses will probably suffer a tad but this song doesn't do much for me. Granted, her vocals are as great as always and the song has a nice, relaxing mood but either this kind of track is too familiar (a kind of Athair part 2 if you will) or it's just not as memorable. 7/10Tea-House Moon: Very oriental in its instruments, it's another wordless song although it's more enjoyable than From Where I Am is, mainly because the melodies are more memorable and it's a bit more song-oriented. It's different but strangely likable. 8/10Once You Had Gold: We're getting into the album's final stretch and the problem is that with this one, it's a more quieter affair as you can feel the album almost winding down. With Enya's more higher vocals (for some reason, reminiscent of her Silent Night rendition), it's another beautiful track but it's also a bit...same-y? 8/10La Sonadora: Spanish lyrics for once, it's another slower paced track complete with \"aahs\" for background vocals and synths but again, the album could've benefited from a more perkier track. I do like what it does at the halfway point and gives the track a little boost. 7.5/10On My Way Home: A church organ opens the track and with a more bouncy synth, you'd think it was a bit more upbeat. While it's not as lively as her vocals on Anywhere Is, it does give the album a bit more memorable closer, especially when the chorus comes where the track gets more fuller in its arrangements. 9/10While A Day Without Rain or Watermark is usually marked as one of her best (probably because her big hits Only Time and Orinoco Flow were on them), I find the Memory of Trees a more likable album and despite a lack of more upbeat tracks, it's still one of her finest outings.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "4.5; music to dream to", "unixReviewTime": 1200528000, "reviewTime": "01 17, 2008"}

Hamlow", "helpful": [62, 65], "reviewText": "Who knows why I initially considered this to be a duff album by the woman with the most beautiful voice in the world.  Maybe I was expecting Shepherd's Moon Part II and saw Memory Of Trees as Shepherd's Eclipse.  The songs didn't leap out to me?  Well, listening to it for this review, it finally did, and I've embraced it like I have her other albums.  The four years inbetween albums was worth it.Of the opening instrumental title tracks, &quot;The Memory Of Trees&quot; is the most potent, sporting the usual instrumentals, pianos, haunting wall-of-sound choir-like vocals, pounding drums recalling &quot;The Longships&quot; from Watermark.The brisk &quot;Anywhere Is&quot;, whose dominant tempo reminds me of a horse having a gentle canter down a park, is backed by strings and backing vocals.  There's an interesting motif in the first line of her reaching a horizon but finding another, where something that looks like an end is actually a new beginning.  Bit like life, isn't it?&quot;Pax Deorum&quot; is a Latin track begins with a cold dark wind, which sets the grim bass pulsing keyboard permeating throughout the song, as well as an ominous sound that sounds a bit like a foghorn, though not as loud or brash.  This part sounds a bit like an incantation.  Her voice alternates between a soft but lower register and her full vocals.The piano (and later some other instrument) ballad &quot;Athair Ar Neamh&quot; is a sad but beautiful sung tune, full of yearning.  Makes me want to learn Gaelic.  My favourite song here, and Enya sounds her best singing like this.The wistful, reflective piano only instrumental &quot;From Where I Am&quot; is a variation of &quot;Miss Clare Remembers&quot; from Watermark, with some shades of &quot;Epona&quot; from the Enya album.&quot;China Roses&quot; is one of her visual and visionary poetic songs and it's an enchanting delight to hear.  I see melodic strains of what would later become &quot;Only Time.&quot;  That wall of sound really enhances her vocals, and the following lyrics really create the image of a dreamland:  &quot;A new moon leads me to/woods of dreams and I follow/a new world waits for me/my dream, my way&quot; and &quot;Rain and river, a world of wonder/may be paradise to me&quot;.  Gosh, how I love this woman!OK, all you romantics.  &quot;Hope Has A Place&quot; is the song for you.  Enya's vocal echoes hauntingly here and that dreamy wall of sound is in full bloom.  And how's this for some sagely advice:  &quot;Look to love/you may dream/and if it should leave/then give it wings/But if such a love is meant to be/Hope is home, and the heart is free.&quot;  I can't decide whether I like this better than &quot;Athair Ar Neamh.&quot;The third instrumental, &quot;Tea-House Moon&quot;, has some Oriental strains, with some otherworldly synths and conjures the image of one looking up at the stars.  As for the title, a nod to Teahouse Of The August Moon, set in post-WW2 Japan and starring Machiko Kyo?&quot;Once You Had Gold&quot; is a proverbial seasons come, seasons go type, and has a mystical sense of why things go wrong:  &quot;No-one can promise a dream for you/Time gave both darkness and dreams to you.&quot; and &quot;What is the dark, shadows around you/why not take heart in the new day?&quot;&quot;La Sonadora&quot; is her first Spanish song and it's more an interlude.  The backing wall of music rise to a crescendo in the song's midsection.A reminiscing night traveller's thoughts comprise &quot;On My Way Home&quot;, where &quot;I remember all the best days/I'm on my way home/I can remember every new day&quot; is surrounded by the dreamy wall of sound.Compared to her first three albums, Enya's voice is more mesmerizingly beautiful than I've ever heard.  She seems to be a one-woman band here, as it's &quot;all instruments and vocals by Enya&quot; per the credits.  There's more a wall of dreamy sound here--check out how many times I've mentioned this.  Repeated listenings will tell whether it'll dislodge Shepherd's Moon as my favourite Enya album.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Dreamy unearthly magic continues with Eire's one and only!", "unixReviewTime": 1059523200, "reviewTime": "07 30, 2003"}

For certain, The Memory Of Trees is melodic, romantic and sensuous. Roma Ryan's lyrics, sung in  Gaelic by Enya (Athair Ar Neamh), float gently like pillow-soft white  clouds. The compositions are relaxing and harmonious (Tea House Moon),  dreamlike and filled with mystery (Once You Had Gold), and include subtle  touches of Celtic tradition (Enya's phrasing on `Hope Has A Place'). The CD  is a quiet and lush alternative to ninety-percent of the popular music on  the market today, and also a welcome substitute for the often hectic pace  of daily life. Enya's arrangement of the compositions on Memory is well  thought - the comparatively dramatic and uplifting `Anywhere Is' and `On My  Way Home' are placed so that the listener doesn't fall asleep.However,  I'm very leery when I read a dozen reviews of a particular musical release,  and all the writers rate the artist's work with five-stars. My hesitation  is not a matter of taste (listeners are free to condemn or rave about  whatever they please), but one of perspective. Is The Memory Of Trees a  musical ground breaking effort? Does it introduce a unique technique or  significantly alter a current genre of popular music? On close listening,  the electronic pseudo-symphonic music of Memory does not approach the  beauty or dynamics of an orchestra with real people playing real  instruments. Nor does Enya's multi-layering of her own voice have the same  rich sonic texture as a chorus comprised of real voices. Then again,  perhaps The Memory Of Trees (and all of Enya's work) is so provocatively  ethereal because it is surreal.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Have You Hugged A Tree Today?", "unixReviewTime": 959385600, "reviewTime": "05 27, 2000"}

I consider her to be one of the few female singers who in my opinion can still make some great angelic melodies that don't sound banal or cheap even though some of her songs are so short as to be almost like unfinished demo tapes( Will she someday produce and compose a song that is about eight ot nine minutes long). The Memory Of Trees is my second favorite CD of hers behing Watermark which I consider to be her strongest outing to date. I doubt Enya will topple Watermark to tell you the truth.Many people say that this is a sunny album. Well, it is kind of true. The sunniness is evidenced on the title track, Anywhere Is, and the Orinoco Flow-esque On My Way Home. Generally I think of this album as an album for a cloudy, romantic autumn evening with the leaves a bright red, orange and yellow. Several songs are quite dark and cloudy but not stormy like let's say Storms In Africa, Exile, or creepy like Evening Falls. This album is a gorgeous musical journey that trancends boundaries. I find this to be like the darker companion to the sunniness of A Day Without Rain which followed this one five years later.I usually go with the darker material that Enya does but I enjoy the brighter material as well( I love music that is dark and stormy).The title track is a gorgeous instrumental that has Enya returning to the days of the Celts CD. Instead of the usual piano instrumental that introduced us to Watermark, Shephard Moons, and A Day Without Rain we get a song that is more synthesized and with thundering beats to bop your head to combined with Enyas multilayered vocals that starts out as a cloudy minor note and after about 30 seconds it morphs into a major note to give an impression of the sun shining through the clouds on a warm autumn afternoon. This song is more similar to the Celts than the piano instrumentals of most of her albums although this song is much brighter than the Celts title track. Anywhere Is is like the blueprint of Enyas big-selling A Day Without Rain. It's a very bright, sunny song with rhythm that could make you almost bop your head along with. This song is more legato although there are hints of the staccato pizzicato strings that would dominate a lot of Enyas A Day Without Rain. I love the quiet middle part of the song. It kind of reminds me of the quiet bridge of Orinoco Flow a few years before then. After the sunniness we head into darker, mistier territory of Pax Deorum. This song is another dark almost Gothic piece that features Enya singing in Latin with a very misty feel. In the middle of the song the rhythm pauses and the sing becomes a major note for about a minute giving an imression of the sun breaking through the dark clouds. I consider this to be Enyas best 'Gothic' song to this day. It's almost like the darker side of Heaven if you could call it that. The song reverts back into a dark misty minor note song. Athair Ar Neamh is a very sad, cloudy evening song that features Enya singing in Gaelic. This song is a very beautiful, theme for a guy who is having a lonely summer. The song ends in a major note key like the sun breaking out just before it goes down. From Where I am is a beautiful piano instrumental. China Roses is a gorgeous, breathtaking, ambient song that made me get this album. It's one of Enyas most stunning compositions to date in my opinion. China Roses is a very romantic song that brings up images two lovers walking alongside the waterfront with the red leaves falling onto the surface of a pond with a large garden of roses and a huge crystal castle in the background. China Roses is one of Enyas most brilliant songs to this day. This song is the winner on the Memory Of Trees. Hope Has A Place is a another beautiful song that is similar to China Roses although not quite as powerful or mind- stimulating but still great. This song is a song about how hope is still existant even in bleak situations. This song reminds me of How Can I Keep From Singing from Shepard Moons. Tea-House Moon is one of the best Enya instrumentals I have ever listened to. It's a very stunning song with high pitched synths in the background with electronic synths in the foreground. This song is one to enjoy when it's cloudy and the red leaves are falling to the ground. This song is one of my favorites off this CD. Once You Had Gold is one song that you probably shouldn't play if you have not had much sleep because it's one song that will sooth your soul. I fell asleep in class a few times in the past listening to this song *giggles*. This song though is great though. I enjoy it alot on a cloudy evening. La Sonadora is a very haunting song that features Enya singing in Spanish. This song is very dark and spooky although not stormy or scary as let's say Exile, Storms In Africa or the dynamite Na Leatha Geal M'Oige but this song is one of the darker songs off this album. The chants remind me a bit of Smaointe from a decade ago. We brighten up again with the closing track On My Way Home. This song that contains many elements of the 1988 hit Orinoco Flow although not as spooky as that one. This song is much brighter than Orinoco and happier. This song is like the predecessor to the brightness of A Day Without Rain that followed this one five years later...I consider this to be one of Enyas strongest albums to date. Only Watermark surpasses this one and it's not by too much. I strongly recommend that all Enya fans buy this amazing masterpiece.

Enya is not an artist who blends in with the rest and this release is, in my opinion, her best to date.There is certainly an ethereal quality associated with new age and Enya is certainly a new age artist, but she has strong writing skills and gorgeous and very unique voice that sets her apart from her peers. And if you look at what is being released these days, many groups are ripping off elements of her uniqueness and plastering them on down tempo songs with session singers who do an ok job of copying Enya, but don't reach the depths of beauty and passion that only Enya seems to find.What makes this a 5-star review for me is that the songs work independently and even better as a cohesive set that keeps you involved and feeling like you are living in an even better world than this one we know.

But for her to have essentially taken the crown of this genre implies a depth to her music, and this is very evident on \"The Memory of Trees\".Enya's first few albums were good, but there was something missing, something that had yet to be developed. I'm not entirely sure what that intangible \"something\" was, but she certainly found it on this one. The title track is an instrumental masterpiece featuring her trademark layered vocals (though no lyrics to speak of), and it reminds on of a clear fall day. This sets the pace for the record, which is decidedly autumnal. 'Anywhere Is' is about the maze that life's choices put us into, while 'Pax Deorum' features few lyrics (all in Latin) that reverberate almost like a dark stormy night that eventually settles into a calm drizzle. 'Once You had Gold' is as delicate as a falling leaf, and 'On My Way Home' brings back memories of weekend trips home from college, traveling through the gorgeous foliage and dizzying scents of fall.If 'Only Time' defined her \"A Day without Rain\" album, it's 'China Roses' that defines \"The Memory of Trees\". Enya has crafted a lullaby-like soothing piece of moonlight that is instantly calming. It's easily the best piece of the record and, even nearly twenty years after the album's release, it still stands firmly, refusing to sound dated in a genre that, at one point, relied a little too much on synthesizers.It's been over fifteen years since \"The Memory of Trees\" was released, but it's a still favorite when it comes to Enya's music.

Holder \"The Review's the Thing\"", "helpful": [12, 13], "reviewText": "The problem with Enya is that she is so consistently good.  It is difficult to write a review that says something different from previous reviews (having recently reviewed \"A Day without Rain\" and previously \"Watermark\").  The same words, ethereal, ephemeral, airy, haunting, and spiritual apply to each album.  The only risk is that my reviews become boring, because Enya could never be.This CD begins with the instrumental track \"The Memory of Trees.\"  While \"The Memory of Trees\" is nominally an instrumental, there are voices that punctuate portions of the music.  This opening feels optimistic, though the title feels as though it is vaguely related to forests and lands gone by.  The vocals provide a chorale sound that builds and cascades around you with the feeling of great trees and landscapes greater than any of the puny works of mankind.  Great beasts wander about and smaller beasts enter and exit the brush at the edges of clearings in the great forest in a celebration of nature.The pace speeds up in the peppy \"Anywhere Is.\"  The lyrics are poetic and symbolic and are a mirror maze of mental images.  As is frequently typical of Enya the lyrics seem to make sense until you attempt to understand them and then their meaning escapes your grasp.  In this case the song seems to be describing the paths we take in life and the choices that we make, and whether they can be unmade, and even whether the choices take us to or from the one we love.  Another unusual feature of this song is the predominant instruments which compete for attention with Enya's voice.  Typically Enya's voice stands out clearly from the instruments, which in this case are mostly strings and piano.\"Pax Deorum\" is somewhat ominous, and fits with the following song, \"Athair Ar Neamh.\"  Both songs are simple songs that relate to God.  \"Pax Deorum\" translates roughly as \"The Peace of the Gods,\" or seeking to placate the gods.  \"Athair Ar Neamh\" translates approximately as \"Father in Heaven.\"  Note that the title of the latter song appears as a line in the former song, tying both songs together, and placing an Irish Gaelic line into a Latin song.  There are moments of choral lightness in the otherwise ominous \"Pax Deorum,\" which I believe has appeared as the background music for a commercial.  The latter song is more contemplative and ethereal and Enya allows the beauty of her voice to caress and harmonize the Irish Gaelic verses.\"From Where I Am\" is a relatively sedate instrumental that forms a brief piano interlude leading into \"China Roses.\"  This song manages to capture the wonder of the universe and the beauty of heaven all in one song.  This song transcends the poetic to the surrealistic both lyrically and vocally.  Once again Enya allows her voice to be a beautiful instrument to complement the strings and piano to create a work of aural art.\"Hope Has a Place\" is the first song where the lyrics are relatively easy to understand.  The concept is simple: there is always hope where there is love.  The vocals are beautiful (again) and may remind a listener of the song Enya wrote for \"The Lord of the Rings.\"  This song is for romantics and candle-lit dinners everywhere.Another instrumental interlude follows.  \"Tea-House Moon\" has some of the most interesting instrumental effects on this CD.  The mood is contemplative and traditional, though with a vaguely Asian flavor.  This instrumental is the music for a heavenly choreography.The next song changes style, again, and yet fits within the character of the album.  \"Once You Had Gold\" seems to allude to the transitory nature of all things, perhaps most particularly life.  There are lines that seem to say that things come and things go, and you need to accept the joys that you can get just from being here to greet the new day.  I particularly like the last line which says that there are no promises in life, that there is good and bad and that one must make the best of any situation.  The song is sung in a fairy tale style, a cautionary tale young and old.The next song translates as \"The Dreamer.\"  The music tells you all you need to know about the words, which are surrealistic and, of course, dream-like.  The ephemeral lyrics and music bespeaks an atmosphere, a feeling, a place that can only exist in our dreams, though we might wish otherwise.

Except where noted otherwise, each song is sung in English.Enya is one of the best composers and performers I know to unwind with; another in this category is Ryan Miller, who composed the soundtracks for the video games MYST and RIVEN.\"The Memory of Trees\" (instrumental and voices, no lyrics) Waltz tempo, opening with electronic keyboard, joined by piano. Enya joins in vocally but without words partway through. The main theme is about six notes long, continually repeated with variations. One of my two favourites on this CD, ranked only after \"China Roses\".\"Anywhere Is\" Unusually staccato for Enya, mainly string accompaniment. No percussion, some piano. The lyrics are very distinct and easy to follow except during the chorus, when the louder volume of the accompaniment and softer singing obscures the words a little. (\"You go there you're gone forever / I go there I'll lose my way / if we stay here we're not together / Anywhere is\").\"Pax Deorum\" (sung in Latin) Noticeably deeper pitched-chorus and accompaniment than usual. The accompaniment includes some percussion, in this case base drum, although the beat is mainly carried by the keyboard.\"Athair ar Neamh\" is sung in Gaelic, with very quiet keyboard accompaniment so that Enya's voice carries the main lyrics very clearly. During the chorus, a multiple-track arrangement wherein she appears to sing with herself blurs the effect a little. Very clear and bell-like, on the whole.\"From Where I Am\" (instrumental only) Specifically piano. As usual with Enya, her piano solo here makes me think of water imagery.\"China Roses\" Waltz tempo again, opening with electronic keyboard, but most of the accompaniment is covered by piano. \"I know that if I have heaven / there is nothing to desire; Rain and river, a world of wonder / may be paradise to me.\" Most of the verses contain a reference to heaven, the night sky.\"Hope Has a Place\" I would tentatively call this waltz tempo again, but it's very slow, and the beat isn't quite regular. Enya's singing comes through very clearly herein (except for the more complex choruses, as usual). The accompaniment consists of very simple chords on an electric keyboard so as not to drown out the singing. The refrain is \"Hope has a place in a lover's heart.\"\"Tea House Moon\" (instrumental) Unusually electronic feel to the keyboard carrying the melody in this one. Doesn't seem typical of Enya's work.\"Once You Had Gold\", 'once you had silver / Then came the rains / out of the blue. / Ever and always, / always and ever,\" with the refrain \"Time gave both darkness and dreams to you.\" Waltz tempo again, almost a lullaby in this instance, Enya's singing dominating the piano and keyboard accompaniment with a wordless chorus.\"La Sonadora\" - Sung in Spanish, very drowsily, waltz tempo again. The quiet accompaniment is primarily voice with some very deep string, with organ joining in after a couple of verses.\"On My Way Home\" - Opens with organ accompaniment, as in the later part of the previous song, but then switches to a very staccato keyboard accompanying Enya's singing. \"On my way home / I remember / only good days.\"", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "11 tracks", "unixReviewTime": 1114473600, "reviewTime": "04 26, 2005"}

The rest of the album seemed a  reflection of this, and as with 'Watermark' it was a generally cheery  collection. Still, despite an excellent set of opening songs, the album  seemed to bog down into too many ballads towards the end ('La Sonadora',  although introducing Spanish to Enya's vocabulary, went on and on and on),  despite the presence of the rousing 'On my way home' as a closing song. The  title track seemed uncomfortably close to being a cliche, too.Despite  all that, it was business as before - the production seemed more earthy and  less ethereal, and 'On my way home' was the closest thing to a mainstream  single Enya has ever done.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Pop", "unixReviewTime": 958867200, "reviewTime": "05 21, 2000"}

People tend to get really tired of hearing her all the time. E.O. - Enya Overdose - can be an unpleasant, almost sickly experience. Aside from that, I think some people are just jealous of her enormous popularity. I just learned that her \"Day Without Rain\" CD which came out in 2000 was the 16th highest seller of the last decade.But she's wildly popular for good reasons. One could say her music is synthesized plastic, but it's beautiful, soothing plastic . . . what's not plastic is Enya's sweet, melodic voice (at least I HOPE it's not plastic! - I sincerely doubt she uses auto-tune). Enya's been accused of being soulless - harsh! - but sometimes you'd rather hear something calming, pleasant and pretty instead of some gut-wrenching Aretha Franklin or Janis Joplin weeper, wouldn't you?The following is a song-by-song breakdown of the album to give readers an idea of which tracks they might like to sample before getting the whole album:\"The Memory of Trees\" - a majestic, cinematic opener. No lyrics, it serves as a wonderful prelude. *****\"Anywhere Is\" - I know some people like this one but I find it unbearable. To me, it's too cloying, \"sing-songy\" and flat-out dorky. It's just too \"jaunty\" for my tastes. I'm forced to program the songs on my CD player whenever I want to hear this album because I refuse to listen to this one (and of course, I program only certain songs from this album for massage). I was shocked to see it on Enya's Greatest Hits collection. *\"Pax Deorum\" - Quite different than anything else here, this track has an ominous, pulsing sound which makes me think of impending war in some Medieval or Lord of the Rings setting. Enya chants most of the words, sung in Gallic, in a low register. I never use it for massage but it's an interesting track if yer in the mood for it. ***1/2\"Athair Ar Neamh\" - Another one sung in Gallic, this soft, restrained song is one of the most beautiful on the album. *****+\"From Where I Am\" - is a short instrumental with only piano and some very subtle atmospheric touches. A sweet melody. *****\"China Roses\" - possibly Enya's best song ever. Sounds like floating through heaven. Magical! *****+\"Hope Has a Place\" - a gentle song about love. ****1/2\"Tea-House Moon\" - a pretty instrumental, vaguely Oriental. ****\"Once You Had Gold\" - another, soft, sweet song with a gorgeous melody. ****1/2\"La Sonadora\" - is a subtle, slightly somber track sung in Spanish. ****\"On My Way Home\" - begins with some rolling, old-school synth sounds reminiscent of her first album and soon bursts with bright energy.

Her voice is fitting for the style of music she sings. Clear as a bell, her voice is airy and light, as she sings in English, Latin, or Gaelic. There is a lot of power in her voice. The music she chooses supports her voice appropriately, and adds to her sound. She has the ability to conjure up images with each note she sings. Like all of her previous albums, this one is again excellent.There are a many great songs on this album. \"China Roses\" has that airy sound that Enya is well known for. She sings the backing vocal as an arpeggio of three long notes of just her voice. Over it, she sings the lyrics of the song in her crisp tone, almost like a crystal bell ringing. The Latin sounding \"Pax Deorum\" has a medieval sound to it. Again, she utilizes her voice singing in the background, to add counterpoint to the lyrics.  \"Anywhere Is\" sounds like the perfect single for the album. Much more upbeat than the other songs, it has a very staccato feel making it a very energetic song. On the opposite end of the spectrum is \"Hope Has a Place\". Here her voice has a very haunting quality to it, made even more so with the organ playing behind her. It is a very beautiful song.I'm amazed at how Enya can keep making new albums that sound similar to her previous ones, yet be totally new for the listener as well. Her voice is aging well, and she seems to improve with each passing album. I hope to hear much more from her in the future, as there is always room in my collection for her beautiful voice.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Beautiful", "unixReviewTime": 1044921600, "reviewTime": "02 11, 2003"}

In short, that's what \"The Memory Of Trees\" is, a collection of sweet and hushed songs designed to put one at ease and carry them into a peaceful sleep. Now one would think that since the title of the album deals with trees, the whole work itself would have an environmental theme to each of its songs, but it does not. Enya started this cycle when her debut album \"The Celts\" featured celtic chants and jigs, her second album \"Watermark\" had a collection of water themed songs, and her third album \"Shepherd Moons\" had songs that dealt with a world beyond this one. Actually, \"The Memory Of Trees\" does a very nice job of breaking this cycle, because there are only a few songs that deal with anything related to trees or the environment, and all of them are highlights of the album. These include \"The Memory Of Trees\", which is the opening track and one of her best songs ever composed, \"China Roses\", a beautifully crafted pastorale and \"La Sonadora\", a descriptive narration of dreams of landscapes. This album is probably one of the few Enya collections that have 3 instrumental tracks, all of which are very nice transitions to each section of the album. I do not advise you to play the album in its entirety in your car, because you will surely fall asleep. True that's the greatest strength of the album, but also its fatal weakness.

Despite stiff competition, Changing Faces, a duo of New York songstresses, attained commerical success with their self-titled debut. This was due mainly to the superb lead single \"Stroke U Up\" (platinum single sales) and the follow-up \"Foolin' Around\", each produced by R. Kelly.

Even though their debut was commercially successful, better records would later turn up for Changing Faces, namely their 3rd set, despite not acheiving the accompanying sales.

The Car's debut was NOT on that list.  It was, however, on the Top 10 Debuts We Love To Hate list.  From my standpoint, they were in good company among artist such as Queen, Dire Straits and Boston.  Being a British magazine, Q may have simply missed the influence this album generated since it wasn't that big in the UK (#29).  My Best Friend's Girl (#3) became a major hit but in great part due to the single being among the first singles (if not the very first) released as a picture disc (shaped like a car).  Just What I Needed (#17) barely crawled into the top 20 and that was practically it for the Cars until they stroke gold internationally with songs from their Heartbeat City album.In the States this album would hardly be treated similar compilations.  My Best Friend's Girl (#27), Just What I Needed (#35) & Good Times Roll (#41) became radio staples and really much more popular than their Billboard top 100 rankings indicate.  During its release it was still common on late night radio shows to play whole sides.  The three songs already being hits on side A, side B became a popular choice for such occasions.  The album didn't set the charts on fire, barely sneaking in the top 20 (#18).  With continuous airplay of many of the album's tracks sales were consistent, which in the States matters much more than in most other territories.  It wound up being among the top 30 sellers of the decade, selling 6 million copies, an incredible achievement for an album not even close to cracking the top 10.  The Cars, both band and album, thus became huge in the States.There are a few things special about this album.  At the time of its release, 1978, its producer, Roy Thomas Baker, was in huge demand, mainly due to his work with Queen.  With Queen, the production was full of sound effects and bombastic vocalizations (Bohemian Rhapsody is a prime example).  The production on The Cars is, however, sparse on most of the album (the intros of My Best Friend's Girl and Just What I Needed are especially good examples).  This made the use of synthesiser more prominent in a sense.  The texts were filled with Ric Ocasek's irony which he delivered in a dead panned way; along with the late Benjamin Orr's more emotional approach in singing.  In between this sparse production came forceful harmonies, e.g. on You're All I've Got Tonight and Good Times Roll.  Combined, this gave the Cars a punkish feel, what today would be labelled as post-punk rock.  This sounded very fresh from the typical rock sound which at that point dominated the airwaves as some kind of alternative to balance the popularity of disco.Actually, it is remarkable how fresh the music still sounds today, more than 25 years after its release.  Many groups today are basically doing similar things but now it is viewed as being retro.  There is, however, one major drawback on buying this CD (meaning 4 instead of 5 stars).  The sound quality is below par, which becomes more evident listening to their Just What I Needed Anthology.  Despite being 10 years old, the re-mastering job on that release draws forth the sloppy transfer to CD.  The sound is very low although not being muddled as many other badly transferred records.  This album really could use some re-mastering (there is one available, a deluxe version from 1990 with an extra demo disc; there have, however, been many albums re-mastered originally released later with clearly audible results so that version does not cut it in my books).  Given the sonic achievements that have been done with old Queen releases (the recent 30th anniversary edition of A Night at the Opera could have been recorded yesterday), this album should have tremendous potential in being a major re-release.  Not only would a re-mastering job be welcome but a hybrid SACD version would have the potential of making these classics fresher than ever.Ric, are you reading this?!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A Fine Tuned Debut", "unixReviewTime": 1158537600, "reviewTime": "09 18, 2006"}

It simultaneously fulfilled all of my most pertinent musical cravings, serving up a flawless three-and-a-half-minute cocktail of crunching power chord heroics, sharp melodic hooks, hopelessly clever lyrics, and vocals that were both quirky and impassioned. It was the perfect pop song, but with enough spiky alt-new wave attitude to imbue it with a sense of genuine cool. Every time I cue it up, it takes me back to tenth grade, to that joyful year that saw me fall helplessly in love with my best friend. \"Just What I Needed\" is the sound of pure, hopeless joy, of butterflies in the stomach and lightness in the head, of wry, knowing angst and cheekily self-deprecating humor. It's the sound of smart people letting their emotions sneak up on them. Beautiful!But the most mind-boggling thing about \"Just What I Needed\" is that it's not even my favorite song here! That honor would probably go to \"Bye Bye Love,\" which is a brittle, cynical masterpiece. It's a simple breakup song that somehow manages to turn the whole notion of love inside out, and every one of its hooks is stuffed with bitterness and paranoia and caustic wit. In fact, I'd say that this album is worth the price of admission purely on the basis of Ric Ocasek sneering \"you think you're so illustrious/ you call yourself intense.\" It's one of the most withering putdowns in the history of pop music, rivaling even the more acidic moments of This Year's Model and Highway 61 Revisited.The other seven songs are icing on the cake.

The songs are: \"Just What I Needed\"/\"I'm in Touch with Your World\" (5/29/78), \"Best Friend's Girl\"/\"Don't Cha Stop\" (10/10/78), and \"Good Times Roll\"/\"All Mixed Up\" (2/27/79).I've always had a great appreciation for The Cars' lyrics.

As an example, look at the opening lyrics of \"All Mixed Up\":she shadows me in the mirrorshe never leaves on the lightand some things that I say to herthey just don't seem to biteWhen you read The Cars' (typically Ric Ocasek's) lyrics you feel surrealistic.  Once you understand you are to picture images of feelings, or feel the feelings yourself, you gain an understanding of how the singer/songwriter is feeling.The Cars insisted they are music performers and not an \"act\", preferring to be known for their music rather than their ability to look flashy or jump around on stage.  Fortunately for us, the listeners, that desire translates into musical quality and sincerity.  This music has a pop feel to it, but with enough of a hard edge that pushes it towards the boundary between pop and hard rock.The musical style is somewhat dated, feeling like the late 70s music that it is, but it has aged to the point where it is now classic rock.

One of the great appeals of Ric Ocasek is the playful, yet classy, and savagely witty way in which he wrote about sex, how there's so much more to it than just 'getting laid'--there's a certain desperation mixed with vulnerability in songs like \"Just What I Needed\" and \"You're All I've Got Tonight\".The opening \"Good Times Roll\" sets the scene perfectly, with Ric offering us a feel-good anthem fed through his own warped sensibility.  \"My Best Friend's Girl\" is a wonderfully entertaining 'modernization' of Buddy Holly's patented sound.  \"Don't 'Cha Stop\", with its \"Pleasant Valley Sunday\"-ish opening riff, is album's sole uptempo track--the chorus feels rather tossed off, but it's still a very fine track, with great layered guitar lines on the verses.  The \"I Can't Explain\"-esque \"Bye Bye Love\" has a very upbeat-sounding tune, but the ominous lyrics and Ben Orr's marvelously stylish vocal delivery help make it the perfect lead-in to the album's final two tracks...\"Moving In Stereo\" was cooked up by Ric and Greg Hawkes in Ric's basement, making it the one track on the album Ric didn't write on his own.  And what a classic it is.  David Robinson's drums are tweaked a bit, giving them a noticeably brash quality.  Hawkes offers a synth line that's creepy and defiant without sounding melodramatic.  Perfect vocals from Ben Orr--could this man ever sing.\"All Mixed Up\" ends the album in cathartic fashion--great dynamics, sumptuous vocal harmonies, and a stirringly emotional climax with a brilliantly-placed keyboard lick from Hawkes and Ben Orr once again working magic with his powerful, commanding vocals.I also must not fail to mention \"I'm In Touch With Your World\", another 'hidden' gem contained herein.  It shows that Ric could wring a quirky chord progression out of his guitar if he really tried.  Ric delivers an ultra-edgy lead vocal--it has a great, bugs-under-your-skin quality to it.  And all the percussion, sudden blasts of sound effects, and 'tick-tock' synths on the chorus punctuate this mostly stripped-down track marvelously.Lead guitarist Elliot Easton isn't spotlighted as much as he would be on the subsequent \"Candy-O\", but you can hear how the man was a big believer in 'serving the songs'--check out his well-placed rockabilly licks (instantly reminiscent of the Beatles' \"I Will) on \"My Best Friend's Girl\", or his fine, if rather brief, solo on \"Just What I Needed\".So, you may think you know this album all too well already.  But, I suggest perhaps there's a bit more to this than you realize--after all, with a group like The Cars, things are often not as they seem.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "endless radio airplay aside, this remains a truly great, kickass album", "unixReviewTime": 1150243200, "reviewTime": "06 14, 2006"}

To my mind, The Cars continued the poprock tradition of artists like Queen, Alice Kooper and Roxy Music, whilst there is also a specifically new wave feel about this album that reminds me of an obscure contemporary of theirs, one Mink DeVille, and of course those other famous poprockers Blondie. Of course, Pat Benatar and The Knack mined a similar vein, but they came later.

It just changed the rules of the game.  I went from being a kid who had to be shuttled around to a more active participant in the world at large.  I not only had a new lease on life but also new responsibilities (a 1990 Honda Civic to take care of - my parents' old car that became mine around 1995 or so) that felt adult-like.  I think I grew a lot overall from the experience and now, many years later, can't imagine what life would be like if I couldn't get behind the wheel.I've always associated driving with liberation and excitement, and to this day it's my best place to think.  I have logged a lot of miles on several vehicles over the years and (wait, I'm reviewing something aren't I?) can think of no better soundtrack for this experience than the first Cars album.This album was released the year after I was born, so I certainly didn't \"grow up with it\" through my formative (read: teenage) years like some of the other reviewers here.  However I've always felt a certain kinship with this little classic, as if it's something that I should (in italics) have grown up with.  Perhaps that's because, for all of its virtues, a lot of the music that came about in \"my\" era wasn't particularly fun and catchy.  Driving to Nirvana or Soundgarden is (IMHO) a soup-sandwich unless you're really angry and/or depressed.  The closest corollary is Teenage Fanclub (another band that has created some of my favorite driving music), Fountains Of Wayne (of course) and Canadian band Sloan.The Cars' first disc is the driving album that every generation ought to have, full of good poppy rockin fun with an ever-so-slightly-twisted perspective (arched eyebrows at the ready) that allows you to still feel smart while singing along.  I couldn't ask for more.  However, absent any discoveries yet to be made, I don't believe there is such a thing for Gen-X and beyond. In the meantime, give this a spin the next time you head out on the road and try to picture that rush of liberation that you may have experienced when you first got behind the wheel unsupervised.

Rock and pop with a synth/techno alternative flavor. Classic songs that sounded like nothing else at the time. The Cars were \"New Wave\" before there was New Wave (which hit in the early 80's). 9 songs - with only one question mark (filler?) in \"I'm In Touch With Your World\". The other 8 tracks were gold (the album reached #18 on the Billboard Pop charts and has sold over 6 million units). Ric Ocasek's quirky voice teamed with bassist Ben Orr's smooth voice worked well together. Greg Hawke on keyboards made & pulled this band tighter. The songs that made it to major air-waves were \"Let The Good Times Roll\", \"My Best Friend's Girl\", and \"Just What I Needed\". But, check out tracks 6-9... \"You're All I've Got Tonight\", \"Bye Bye Love\", \"Moving In Stereo\" and \"All Mixed Up\" run together fluidly - these are awesome album tracks. Sure this band looked like a bunch of geeks, but man when they came together with their instruments, they really made some beautiful music. Only their 2nd album \"Candy-O\" came close, but no album of the Cars was better than this one. This debut is ranked #282 on Rolling Stone Magazine's list of 500 all-time greatest albums. R.I.P.

Sure, '80's Top 40 pop enthusiasts would probably say that about HEARTBEAT CITY (which did sell more records upon release), but real rock fans rate their debut at the top. Why? Because, just like most great rock debuts (such as BOSTON and VAN HALEN), it shows The Cars in hungry mode, pulling out all the stops to create a hard, edgy, and energetic record that was different from anything else out at the time. This band combined hard guitar-rock with a spacey keyboard-driven New Wave sound (that only then was beginning to emerge) in equal amounts, with straightforward, simple lyrics--and created a sound that was raw yet sleek, edgy but commercially accessible, and totally fresh at that time. Between Ric Ocasek and Benjamin Orr's similarly cool, unaffected lead vocals, Greg Hawkes' incredibly cool, futuristic keyboards, and Elliot Easton's slicing, awesome guitar-work, this album was truly unique. It influenced countless other New Wave/rock bands afterwards. It has since stood the test of time, and that's what makes it a true classic.When I first heard THE CARS on a cassette tape 22 years ago, I was already quite familiar with &quot;Just What I Needed.&quot; Then, I really got hooked on &quot;Good Times Roll&quot; and &quot;Best Friend's Girl.&quot; It wasn't until 1982 that I really started liking &quot;You're All I've Got Tonight&quot; and &quot;Bye Bye Love.&quot; The following year, I got into &quot;I'm In Touch With Your World.&quot; But it has only been in the past couple of years that I have totally fallen for the medley of &quot;Moving In Stereo/All Mixed Up.&quot; Talk about a true classic; over the years, every now and then, it's given me something new to love about it!

I was a hard core music fan yet bored with hard rock and prog, embarrassed at the disco movement, too naive to appreciate soul and funk, too cool to listen to top 40/bubblegum and too suburban to accept Brittish punk rock. I was hungry for new, cutting edge tunes since Led Zep, Stones, Tull, Kiss and others became soooooooooo stale.Along comes the Cars.Today, the Cars sound so tame and nostalgic but in 1978, this stuff couldn't be any more hip with the reverb soaked detached vocals, synthasized sounding drums, compressed guitars, and adventerous keyboards. I know it must sound hard to believe but \"Just What I Needed\" was a complete breath of fresh air. Everybody (and I mean everybody...even my guitar teacher, famous shred master Michael Angelo Batio) was intrigued by this fresh sound and they were, sorry for the pun, thought of as truly a \"new wave\" of musical talent. In my high school, the cool kids abandoned everything and embraced hippness of The Cars.Now, in hindsight, it is easy to see why the Cars made such a quick impact. These were hardly young kids but, rather, they were seasoned veterans, honing their craft, writing finely composed songs and applying high quality musicianship. Guitarist Elliot Easton was as good of a chicken picker on a Telecaster as anybody, Ric Ocasek was a seasoned songwriter, Keyboard player Greg Hawkes was a session player and drummer Dave Robinson came out of the Modern Lovers. These guys must have studied Velvet Underground, Lou Reed, Iggy Pop and Roxy Music since you can hear the influences everywhere.Their debut has many of their best songs. \"the good times roll\" has all of the above quality ingredients, the aforementioned cool, detached singing, motorizing guitars and in your face keyboard theme. \"My best friend's girl\" changes the pace beautifully mixing new wave with twanging rockabilly. \"Moving in Stereo\" is a hypnotic, groove oriented song. \"You're all I got tonight\" test your speakers by utilizing all the right stereophonic squibs and squalls.Because these guys were so experienced musically, their sound seems to have quickly moved on and matured, which may have been (ironically) to their disadvantage, since, in the end, they sounded like everybody else.

They broke up in 1975 and the trio joined forces with former Modern Lovers drummer David Robinson and keyboard player Greg Hawkes in 1976.For a year they did well gigging around New England and their demo of \"Just What I Needed\" became a hugely requested song on a local Boston rock station (WBCN for those who want to know). As a result, Elektra Records signed the band and the label decided to pull out the artillery for this new band and have legendary Queen producer Roy Thomas Baker produce this incredible debut which was recorded in London, England at George Martin's AIR Studios with engineer Geoff Workman (another Queen and Journey veteran).When this album came out, it was a smash and 30 plus years later, it is still a masterpiece.The album's first three tracks were all hit singles. \"Good Times Roll\" is a great opening song on this album with a killer guitar riff and what not. Next is \"My Best Friend's Girl\" is another great song and I think of this song from the 1979 Matt Dillon film debut Over the Edge where he told a cop off as the policeman was arresting one of his friends. The song is great too with a guitar solo reminiscent to The Beatles' \"I Will\" in tone. The song that follows was \"Just What I Needed\" which was America's intro to the band and was Orr's vocal debut on a Cars track (Ben and Ric would split the vocals evenly). The track is still a staple of rock radio. This track too appeared in Over the Edge prior to the film's party scene. \"I'm In Touch With Your World\" and \"Dont'cha Stop\" are also great rockers which close the first half of the album with classic Ric vocals (Ric sang most of the first half except as noted). Those tracks ended the first half wanting more.The rock radio staple \"You're All I've Got Tonight\" kicks the second half off in a grand way and is a killer rocker (the only vocal from Ric in the second half as Ben did the rest). \"Bye Bye Love\" is next and another great rocker as well and a rock radio staple as is most of this album. We segue into the classic \"Moving in Stereo\" which is one of the band's best pieces of music and the song is forever etched in our brains as that image of Phoebe Cates in the red swimsuit coming out of the pool in Fast Times at Ridgemont High. The closing \"All Mixed Up\" is a great song as well and a great way to close this album.This album fittingly got the success it deserved and not only did New Wave fans buy and embrace this album in droves but hard rock fans did as well and sold millions and peaked in the US Top 20.This version of the album was remastered in 1998 by Joe Gastwirt and Rhino then upped the anty by issuing a deluxe edition in 1999.Highly recommended!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The Cars' 1978 debut is still one of the greatest rock debuts ever made 30 plus years on", "unixReviewTime": 1237766400, "reviewTime": "03 23, 2009"}

This one.I never gave New Wave a chance before this record, however there was no doubt a lot of fun music on here with a solid rock edge to it. Very cool.

Straddling the line between rock and new wave, the group managed to maintain rock credibility while also racking up some major pop hits.  \"Just What I Needed\" peaked at #27 and has become a rock radio staple.  The single is my favorite song of all time - it so perfectly encapsulates the late 70s new wave scene.  And it's catchy as hell - I have to turn up the radio whenever I hear it.The second single, \"My Best Friend's Girl,\" went to #35; the song starts with handclaps before a major synth line kicks into gear.  Finally, \"Good Times Roll\" just missed the Top 40, peaking at #41.  However, not a single track is filler - any of them could have been a hit.I was a little too young in 1978 to become a Cars fan, although I caught them in their pop heyday, when \"Drive\" was a major hit.  I've picked up the rest of their catalog in the last few years, and I've been blown away by the quality of their music, especially \"The Cars.\"  Propulsive synths combine seamlessly with the rock-edged guitars to form one of the most distinctive sounds ever.  This CD really demonstrates why the Cars became stars - it still sounds completely amazing.\"The Cars\" sold very well when first released and was certified platinum in late 1978.  Since then, the CD has continued to win fans - with certification for sales of 6 million by 1995.

It all starts out with the Boston band's mission statement, 'Good Times Roll', followed by the charming 'My Best Friend's Girl', which contain some of Ric Ocasek's best lyrics. Ric's always been terribly underrated as a songwriter; few writers then or now could be as witty yet moving, dark yet delicate, and loving in his put-downs. 'Just What I Needed', the album's highest charting single, is the debut of the much-missed Benjamin Orr on vocals. This track is truly classic Cars. The next two songs, 'I'm In Touch With Your World' and 'Don't Cha Stop' I used to dislike, but have grown to love them. The former is so disjointed in structure it reminds me a little of the Cars' third album Panorama. While the latter song is one in a long line of ultra-fun fast Cars rockers. 'You're All I've Got Tonight' can either be construed as insulting or pleading. Either way, it's perfect. 'Bye Bye Love' is my favorite from this album; one of Ben Orr's best lead vocals in my opinion.

What he came up with goes even further than the amazing Rubber Soul in melody and harmony development. Brian had a genius ear when it came to crafting melodies, so he was at the height of his powers here. He went to work at this while his fellow Beach Boys were on tour and developed a dozen sophisticated songs that expressed how he was feeling inside. This was totally new in rock music at the time so it is a landmark recording. To open up the album we have &quot;Wouldn't It Be Nice,&quot; which is a sweet song with a phenomenal bridge. &quot;You Still Believe In Me&quot; is a minor melody ballad that is really beautiful. The song is very emotional with moving progressions and is most striking at the part where he sings &quot;I wanna cry&quot; over a feast of notes.&quot;That's Not Me&quot; is sung by Mike Love and is another highlight with its key changes. Then comes &quot;Don't Talk (Put Your Head On My Shoulder),&quot; another emotional ballad that comes to a climax in the middle when Brian tells us to &quot;listen&quot; with the sad violins coming directly afterwards. &quot;I'm Waiting For The Day&quot; is faster and neat, but then comes &quot;Let's Go Away For Awhile&quot; which is a very moving instrumental full of violins, Hawaiian-styled guitar, and strings. &quot;Sloop John B&quot; is said to be the least striking on the album, but it's actually really good and it has a beautiful a capella section in the middle. &quot;God Only Knows&quot; has been called by Paul McCartney the best song ever written; so many excellent songs have been written but it does have excellent harmony vocals and it's another highlight.Then comes the wonderful &quot;I Know There's An Answer,&quot; and after that is &quot;Here Today&quot; which is the most ambitious of all the songs. Although it appears quaint with its production, it has some neat key and tempo changes within its fairly sparse minor-key melody. Next is &quot;I Just Wasn't Made For These Times&quot; which is sung from the heart and is another minor ballad like the rest. Near the end we get the title track, the second instrumental of the album, which uses two coke bottles for percussion and more Hawaiian guitar. Finally &quot;Caroline No&quot; ends the album on a graceful and sad note and shows that this is a truly genius piece of work.

And since the term \"classic album\" is often overdone and often used without care,Brian's own terms seem to define this album very much. And there are very few full lengh albums over the years that I can say exist on more than one level. The works of Marvin Gaye,Stevie Wonder and The Beatles come to mind. This is one of those records I can put on with absolutely no urge to skip over any songs. The key to the entire success of this album was arrangement. Inspired by the vocal harmonies of pop and doo-wop groups along with the wall of sound production of Phil Spector Wilson created this,which basically amounts to his debut solo album co-staring The Beach Boys on vocals and harmonizes. Aside from that Carl,Dennis,Mike and Al had precious little to do with the music on this album. That's where the name comes from. These were,in fact Brian's \"pet sounds\". Based on musical influences that impacted on him personally.This album is home to some truly wonderful songs. Much heard and well known hits such as \"Would'nt It Be Nice\" and \"God Only Knows\" being among them. And interestingly enough if those songs excite and amaze you,than the rest of this album will be right up your alley. Much as The BeatlesSgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Bandwas supposed to be (but which even John Lennon admitted it actually wasn't) this album is completely musically and thematically unified. This is not the work of an adolescent celebrating California surf culture. This is the work of a reflective and yearning 20 something who'd by this point already experienced physical abuse,mental illness and was now married with a baby on the way. Speaking for a generation obsessed with the eternal youth,this sets the record straight on that. On \"I Know There's An Answer\",\"Caroline No\",\"Here Today\" and beautifully chorded pieces such as \"I Just Wasn't Made For These Times\",\"Don't Talk\" and \"That's Not Me\" there's this prevailing sense that the singer-songwriter who once mused about the delights of being \"in my room\" now saw the music world as forcing him to pay a big price for non conformity.Musically? Well on this you here an album that goes for redefining what rock and roll was. Rather than having a lot of distorted guitars in the mix,playing three noisy chords you have elaborate organ/piano/horn/rhythm based songs that are more about melody,harmonic and chordal invention that making noise and \"rocking out\". On the instrumental title track for example you realize this album has a lot more in common with types of Northern soul recordings from Dusty Springfield or Georgie Fame for example. It's not by any means a guitar rock album. Bands such as the High Llama's would later make music very much based on this sound. But it definitely extends off the Beach Boys surf sound into something that comes very directly from Brian Wilson's soul. He would in fact suffer something of an emotional breakdown whilst attempting to outdo himself with the follow up album to this. That also mixed with the fact the blood and sweat perfectionism Brian put into this product wasn't fully appreciated by every member of the Beach Boys.

So it's no small irony that it remains their best and popular album of all time.

Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\", which might be okay since The Beatles were so impressed with The Beach Boys new (at that time) album, but at the same time the comparasion is ridiculous. Both are legendary albums in different ways, and \"Pet Sounds\" for a moment in time made the Beach Boys the greatest rock and roll band in the whole world, even bigger than there friendly competitors The Beatles (who came right back and took the title away from them with \"Revolver\").First off, \"Pet Sounds\" is a far, far departure from the Beach Boys that most people know and love. These songs aren't about fun in the sun, girls, and surfing. Instead, it is a deep examination of the thoughts and dreams of a young boy, and how they change as he grows older and his problems and worries become bigger issues for him to deal with. Many people know that Brian Wilson, the leader of the band and the creator of this album, had many mental problems, and also had various drug addictions at this time as well, so he had a thousand ideas that he was thinking about. Also, Brian was an obsessed perfectionist, he wanted to create an album that was greater than anything that had come out before. He spent hours upon hours in the studio, creating layers upon layers of sound and vocals, using any instrument available (even soda cans!) He created a sound that was more lush and beautiful than anything ever before, creating almost a \"dream\" sound of reflection of a boy becoming a man who for his whole life was yearning for the love and affection that he felt was missing.\"Pet Sounds\" is Brian Wilson's baby, and many even argue that this was his solo debut as a back up band was used on many of the songs instead of his fellow band mates. However, the harmonies and vocals are what make this so pleasing, and only his band mates could help in that. The songs themself are pretty excellent. \"Wouldn't it be nice\", \"Sloop John B.\", and \"God Only Knows\" are the well known songs, and the only ones that you are able to listen to as singles. The other songs you have to listen to along with the album as they paint the whole picture that way. The album is about one man's search for love from boyhood to manhood, and the pain and hurt he goes through in his search for it. If Wilson's lyrics don't make you reflect yourself or even make you feel the pain, then listen again. And again. And see how the album will move you in ways your never felt possible.Such a complex and challenging album to listen to that is essential to every rock and roll fans collection. While this album might have started the break down of Brian Wilson, and while the rest of the band mates didn't necessarily agree with the direction the music was heading in (more songs influenced by drugs and mental illness, which the band wasn't dead set on singing the lyrics to), for one moment this album made them kings. Brian was working on his next project, \"Smile\", when The Beatles released \"Sgt. Peppers.\" After listening to it, Wilson put up his white flag of surrender, the others went back to the simple days of surf rock, and the Beach Boys never reached the level of creativeness and uniqueness as they did with \"Pet Sounds.\"", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A revolution then, a classic today", "unixReviewTime": 1124496000, "reviewTime": "08 20, 2005"}

Certainly there are many bands and singers who have devoted their lives to music, but never, ever have I heard an album that is remotely close to the breathtaking Pet Sounds, as far as work ethic, creativity, perseverence, and in the end, pure perfection.Many people liken Pet Sounds to The Beatles Sgt. Pepper album. People often criticize Sgt. Pepper for taking its influence from the primordial Pet Sounds, but the fact that Brian Wilson was first inspired to make Pet Sounds after he heard Rubber Soul is often overlooked. Here's what he said in the liner notes: &quot;In December of 1965, I heard the album Rubber Soul by the Beatles. It was definitely a challenge for me. I saw that every cut was very artistically interesting and stimulating. I immediately went to work on the songs for Pet Sounds.&quot; As a huge fan of both the Beatles and the Beach Boys, I find it absolutely wonderful and riveting that the two biggest bands from across the seas were involved in somewhat of an artistic spar; one which ended up helping both bands produce some of their greatest music.As far as the individual songs of this album, there are no highs and lows. Pet Sounds stays at a steady constant of brilliance, sounding at an uncalibrated musical high. From the swirling harmonies of the opening Wouldn't It Be Nice to the wonderful coda of Hang On To Your Ego, this recording is thoroughly enjoyable. My personal favorites are Wouldn't It Be Nice, God Only Knows and I Just Wasn't Made For These Times.

The greatest bands of the British Invasion - The Beatles, The Stones, The Kinks - began to reliably deliver sets of all original material instead of dividing their LPs between covers and originals. (The Who's first great album was released in 1967.) Moreover, the LP became more important as a complete artistic statement, resulting in great records (Revolver, Aftermath, Face To Face) rather than simply great singles. While great but fairly simple pop music had been produced prior to this year, 1966 was the year in which rock bands began to challenge themselves, and their audience, with more sophisticated songcraft.The Beach Boys' 1966 release Pet Sounds was the best example of an American band making this leap. Inspired by the previous year's Rubber Soul, Beach Boys mastermind Brian Wilson,along with lyricist Tony Asher, was determined to make a record that would keep them on par with the Fab Four commercially and artistically. Many - including Paul McCartney himself, maybe - would argue that Pet Sounds surpassed Rubber Soul's achievements, only to be outdone itself a few months later by Revolver. (I flatter myself to think that people have read my other reviews, but I make it clear time and again that Sgt Pepper was just another Beatles album, so I am going to disregard it here.) Whatever the case my be, Pet Sounds turned out to be a huge critical smash on both sides of the Atlantic. Strangely, it was less of a commercial hit in America not only than it was in Britain, but than its predecessors in the US had been.I will try, even if I have already partially failed, to avoid rehashing everything that has already been said about Pet Sounds, and attempt to review it strictly on its musical merits and how well it has endured over the past 40 years. By these standards, it is factually a great and  truly unique record. One would search in vain for Chuck Berry-style riffs and solos that were a trademark of their previous records. In fact, the closest thing one finds to guitar riffs at all are the plethora of plump, high-pitched bass lines. But not to worry about the trademark vocal harmonies. They are as plentiful and as gorgeous as ever. The singles are clearly the pillars of the album, and are enough by themselves to make this a worthy record. But while \"Wouldn't It Be Nice\", \"Sloop John B\", \"God Only Knows\", and \"Caroline No\" are all great, \"Don't Talk (Put Your Head On My Shoulder)\", \"That's Not Me\", \"Here Today\", and \"I Know There's An Answer\" are also exceptionally vital numbers. The remaining songs are not quite as great, but they are good enough to help earn Pet Sounds the reputation that it has. Even the two instrumentals are quite strong, and serve as highlights for the unprecedented variety of instrumentation throughout the disc, including tympanis, horns, tubas, Christmas-y bells, and of course, the Theremin. The overall sound of the record is wholesome and magical, and finds kindred spirits in late-Sixties LPs such as Love's Forever Changes and Odessey and Oracle by The Zombies, and in more recent releases like The Flaming Lips' The Soft Bulletin. Hence, Pet Sounds was not a traditional rock record at all when released in May 1966. Rather, it was the origin of what would come to be called baroque or chamber pop.Influence and endurance are essential to an album's \"greatness\". However, it seems to me that sometimes influence and endurance are overemphasized and used to hide the fact that a given record's songs are not really all that good. Ultimately, what good is a great record if it doesn't have great songs on it? Pet Sounds needn't worry about lacking any of the necessary elements. But most importantly, it is the songs themselves that would earn this record the high rating that I have awarded it even if it were not so influential and enduring. In terms of its standing in the Beach Boys catalog, it is obviously their best record, but it is also something equally important: the point at which the sun began to set on these California boys' endless summer. Gone are the surfboards, fast cars, and hamburger stands. That isn't to say that they wouldn't return, but at this time Brian Wilson was dealing more with the fleeting nature of the pleasures of youth, embodied by Caroline, who said she'd never change, but did. In doing so, he created a record that is artistically influential, historically enduring, and - with nary a weak track - truly Great.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Going Through The Emotions", "unixReviewTime": 1153699200, "reviewTime": "07 24, 2006"}

I am innately hostile to canons, their systems of values and generally crippling influence - they close down thought rather than encourage it - but I think it's fair to say that the influence of the Beach Boys, and 'Pet Sounds' in particular, has inspired most of the great imaginative pop of the last three decades.Considering its reputation for sonic adventurousness, I was expecting something more lush, more sound-heavy, but 'Pet Sounds' is actually quite austere, effects never promoted at the expense of the beautiful songs.  The most dominant feature is that thrilling soul-shuddering thump-drum echoing in vast Spector-al spaces, making intense and urgent great catchy songs like 'I'm waiting for the day', 'I know there's an answer' and 'Here today'.There's a mirroring of types on the album, where similar songs reflect and transform each other: the serene sleepiness of 'Don't talk' refracting the shocked tragedy of 'Caroline no'; the frustrated dream of 'Wouldn't it be nice' and the frustrating intentions of 'Here today''s narrator.'Pet sounds' is one of the great exposes of the male psyche, with its less endearing, more devious and self-serving impulses - 'I'm waiting for the day' and 'Here today' especially.  Best of all is the tragi-bathos of 'Sloop John B', a male appropriation of the Shangri-La's' traumatic pop, made un-tragic by youthful male ridiculousness, yet still moving with its (and the album's?) refrain 'I want to go home'.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Pop's Pandora's Box.", "unixReviewTime": 994204800, "reviewTime": "07 4, 2001"}

This is where Brian Wilson's genius can be really appreciated.  This would have been an excellent instrumental album with the exquisite musicianship and execution of each song.  It also allows the listener to spot glaringly to the repetitiousness of many of the songs melodies and  lyrical phrasings.  The vocal harmonies, as always, are outstanding.

The track listing had never grabbed me enough to want to get the album without the reputation given to it by the critics. Anyway, I took a punt. The cd I have is listed as released in 2001, and it has the mono version of the album first, then the stereo mix of the album. There is a bonus track too, which is a reworking of one of the songs on the regular album. On first listen I gave this album 77.5/100. On second listen and after listening to the mono mix as well, it's difficult to rate. If it had 3 or 4 songs I liked as much as \"Sloop John B\", then it could be an easy 5/5. This album would score in the high 80s to 5/5 for me based on the fact that it is just so listenable...no more killer tracks, but no dud tracks either. That's been enough for me in the past to give an album 5/5 too. With a band like The Beach Boys, maybe there is just an expectation of lots of songs up there with their poppy best. On this album they move beyond their lyrically simple but highly infectious surf-pop confections. These songs aren't memorable to me, but I can imagine being pleasantly surprised at how pretty they are if I was to dig this album out again. Of course, \"Sloop John B\" is a great cover by the band, which they turned into a masterpiece. Perhaps it's wrong to expect the other songs to measure up to this? In any case, this album would be more uniform but still very strong without this classic on it...and maybe easier to score.Overall, the album has many pleasant tracks, with symphonic elements to them at times. Lyrics have depth which their early surf-pop songs don't have...not that this was anything but a positive for those early songs. On second listen the album was just an easy listening pleasure, which I've tended to reward here in the past with high scores. A difficult album to rate...it's listenability demands a high score though. Range: 87.5 to 100/100.The all time classic (\"/\"):Sloop John B - iconic intro. Glassy percussion. A killer pop cover of the Caribbean folk song. Has a tuba, I think and great harmonies with good variety in the voices.The best of the rest...on second listen (\">(.)\"):You still believe in me - bumped this up from a \"[.]\". Nice lead vocal tone and melody. Cello? Harpsichord? Has bicycle horn type sound as well.Caroline no - Same bump up as above, but after my third listen, on the mono mix. Has chunky wooden percussion, which is nice. A pleasant track. Harpsichord, big bass notes and a pretty woodwind type of instrument. The outro features a train and barking dogs.Then (\"[.]\"):Wouldn't it be nice - album opener. Iconic lead guitar melody intro. Brass. Good stereo balance (albums of this era were experimenting with the new stereo capabilities and didn't often do stereo well by today's standards).I know there's an answer - catchy piano, tambourine and a tuba type instrument. Double bass plays in a jazzy kind of a way. Symphonic drums. Thoughtful lyrics and a catchy chorus.On second listen (\">[.]\"):Don't talk (put your head on my shoulder) - was hoping that this was a cover of the sugar 1950s pop ballad. It's not. Only has one of the Beach Boys singing on this track. Features organ, bass, piano, violins and cymbal percussion.Let's go away for a while - a pleasant, experimental instrumental. Drums and symphonic drums. Piano, brass, violins, twangy string instrument and xylophone (?),God only knows - horn, bass, sleigh bells (?), interesting tone to the percussion, some sort of keyboard effect, violin and a lovely falsetto by one of the Boys.Here today - piano, tuba, tambourine, symphonic elements like brass. Double bass note picking. Catchy verse (?) parts...I mean like the opening vocal melody.On third listen!  (\">[.]\"):I'm waiting for the day - interesting symphonic drumming and other symphonic elements feature as well. Quiet parts alternate with with percussive passages, which is a little bit catchy.I just wasn't made for these times - bass notes, harpsichord (?), interesting percussion tones at times...(bongos?), symphonic drums at times, woodwind? I think that the mono version of this song may have that novelty instrument which was often used in the 1950s...the one where you waved your hand over an aerial type instrument which created sci-fi type noises...I forget what you call those!The rest:That's not me - organ, dual lead guitar, aboriginal percussion sticks sound, bass drum (?), reflective lyrics. Interesting.Pet sounds - instrumental with symphonic elements. Maracas, brass...including a tuba, twangy lead guitar, bass, interesting drum tone and a tambourine, I think.Hang on to your ego - A bonus track. Very similar to \"I know there's an answer\".

Certainly the copious notes included in the CD booklet here will vouch for that viewpoint. With Wilson finally completing his legendary \"Smile\" recording after a 37-year break, interest in the band's recognizable music will likely cause an upswing in sales, especially for this album, long considered the masterpiece of their lengthy career. Inspired by the Beatles' \"Rubber Soul\", Wilson wanted to make an album that thematically integrated love and even inspirational songs together. He succeeded.With their soaring, yearning harmonies and sunny California dispositions intact, \"Pet Sounds\" is still great and made all the more resonant by its sophisticated instrumental arrangements and Wilson's creative musical invention. Songs like \"Wouldn't It Be Nice\", \"God Only Knows\", \"I Just Wasn't Made for These Times\" and \"Caroline No\" remain classics that go far beyond the aging Gidget set and showcase their amazing abilities as a vocal group. The title track and the especially esoteric \"Lets Go Away for Awhile\" unearth Wilson's talent for multi-tracking and embracing different musical styles without sacrificing the sound that was essentially the band's own. This CD contains a bonus track, \"Hang On To Your Ego\", which is actually an alternate take of \"I Know There's an Answer\", and for die-hard fans, the whole album is repeated in stereo. I still prefer the original mono recordings as they have the pop and crackle that captures a more innocent time in recording, a nostalgic postcard for a band that once had the potential to supplant the Fab Four in creative output. Whereas the Beatles retired amid inner turmoil at the height of their popularity thus assuring their legacy, the Beach Boys languished into a parody of themselves as Wilson was facing demons of his own.

Any fan of rock or pop music should have this CD in their collection, without question.  Once you have it, the recent Brother Years compilation (1970-86) will make a fascinating bookend for &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;.

How about Let's Go Away for A While, I'm Waiting for the Day; Don't Talk (Put Your Head on My Shoulder) or You Still Believe in Me? The group's lack of a good lyricist or instrumentalist hurts even further - the Beach Boys could harmonize, all right, but harmonies can only get you so far. Which is why The Beatles, Simon & Garfunkel, Crosby, Stills & Nash and the Motown acts are all so much better than the Beach Boys - in addition to the harmonies, they also had interesting lyrics, solid instrumentalists, AND great melodies to back the singing up.I understand that this was a big influence on Sgt.

I've owned many versions of this and prior to this release the best sounding version I've heard was an old made in Holland stereo mix version which I have since sold and regretted as I've yet to find \"Trombone Dixie\" anywhere else on a single cd version of the whole album as a bonus track like that version did.I don't have an SACD player and so I may update this later once I spin it on my friend's player soon but even on a standard cd player this version while is very good with respect to previous releases given the original mix isn't the best sounding when compared with restored/remastered releases of it contemporaries mentioned above.  The cardboard gatefold packaging is very nice though and would interest collectors of mlps releases although strictly speaking this is not a true replica of the original vinyl sleeve.  Also included is a 20 page colour booklet with all the lyrics and a Mark Linett essay.Mofi did the best that they could with the material that they had to work with but this is certainly not a reference-quality audio experience.

I like many of the Beach Boys big hits but this CD just doesn't cut it. On the version I borrowed, out of sixteen songs only the four lead tracks-Wouldn't It Be Nice, Caroline No, God Only Knows, and Sloop John B are of high quality. I Know There's An Answer, Here Today, and You Still Believe In Me are slightly captivating among the remaining songs. The problem here at least to my ears is that the songs all have a similar arrangement. Not slow and romantic like Surfer Girl or Warmth of The Sun or fast and jumpy like Fun Fun Fun and Surfin' USA. Its all mid-paced and kind of spacey with a strong lack of ooomph and too many special effects.It boggles the mind how one television broadcast ranked this CD as the third greatest rock n roll album of all time. Geeze Louise, this album barely even rocks!  There is a strong lack of guitar presence throughout this collection and way too many special ef!fects. It trudges along like a sluggish snail and you can hardly wait for it to end. The harmonies all sound the same after a while and Brian hogs most of the lead vocals.  The lyrics may have some special meanings but that's based on the fact that you have not fallen asleep listening to the music.  How anyone can compare this to even the weakest of Beatles records is ludicrous.In my opinion, stick with a good compilation of the Beach Boys. California Girls, Help Me Rhonda, I Get Around, and other early hits will always remain classics and keep any party hopping. I have three of them and they all work fine. However, when Brian Wilson attempted to get too deep and stray away from grooving surfer rhythms, the result is a stony bore.

For decades it has been regarded as a foundational album in rock history, and to some degree I agree with this.  Brian Wilson, Paul McCartney and John Lennon were the visionary rock and roll artists who decided to write songs about more controversial topics than surfing with girls and driving cars fast, and \"Pet Sounds\" was unquestionably Wilson's artistic peak.  So it would only serve to follow that the album should fall into the position of legend.  And it has.  Rolling Stone logged it as #2, behind only \"Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\", in its 2003 ranking of rock's all time best albums.So what's the dilemma?I've always been deeply troubled by awarding the term \"legend\" to an album that doesn't meet with significant consumer response.  I know that can be dangerous, because some albums are so far ahead of their time that commercial success isn't ready for it.  Some would argue that this was the fate of \"Pet Sounds\", but I'm unconvinced.  Two songs, \"Wouldn't It Be Nice\" and \"Sloop John B\", hit the top 10, and \"God Only Knows\" also was a top 40 hit.  So the public still was ready for the Beach Boys sound; they just didn't buy this album in droves.And therein lays my concern.  A band that was as well established as the Beach Boys were not able to bring the public along with it as it progressed from hitmakers to serious musicians.  And other artists have been clearly able to bring the public with them.  The Beatles did it with \"Sergeant Pepper\".  The Rolling Stones did it with \"Let It Bleed\".  Pink Floyd did it with \"Dark Side Of The Moon\".  And in this millennium, Green Day did it with \"American Idiot\".  So most certainly, a shift in lyrical topics can be navigated successfully without a total sacrifice of success.  I can accept that album sales were not as brisk for rock acts in the mid-1960's, but \"Pet Sounds\" charted a lower peak (#10) than 10 of the 11 Beach Boys albums that came before it.  Lyrical shifts are not just topical, but timely - and the audience of the Beach Boys was simply not ready for this album.

I was sitting at a beach house in Delaware, just relaxing, and I decided to pop in a copy of 'Pet Sounds' that I just purchased not too long ago (at the time). I shut my eyes, popped the CD in the player, and entered another universe. I was moved to tears (and it takes a LOT for me to cry). This record completely changed my life.It has taken me forever to write a review on Amazon for 'Pet Sounds,' simply because I couldn't quite find the words to describe Brian Wilson and The Beach Boys' 1966 masterpiece. I still can't honestly. But I'm going to try. But first, in case you don't already understand the background of this record, allow me to \"clue you in.\"In the early 1960s, The Beach Boys consisted of Mike Love, Brian Wilson, Dennis Wilson, Carl Wilson, and David Marks. This lineup released three records from 1962-1963, all consisting of \"fun in the sun\"-esque songs, revolving around the surf, sun, cars, and girls. These records symbolized the California surf sound. Marks left the group in 1963, replaced by original member Al Jardine (although both were in the group at the same time, it was soon obvious that Jardine was going to dominate the rhythm guitar spot -- Jardine had been in the group during its earliest incarnation but left in late-1961 to pursue dentistry, only to return less than two years later). With this lineup change, the group slowly moved towards a more complex sound and added tighter vocal harmonies. In 1964, Brian Wilson suffered a nervous breakdown, and stopped touring. The group initially replaced Wilson on the road with future country and television star Glen Campbell on the road, but this was no long term solution. The group released one final album with the five-piece, 'The Beach Boys Today!' before adding Bruce Johnston to the touring lineup as Brian Wilson's replacement, and, as it turned out, in the studio as well.In 1965, the group released 'Summer Days (And Summer Nights!!),' which is perhaps the precursor to what was to come a year later. This record proved to be their best yet, and showed The Beach Boys maturing as vocalists and lyricists. But even in '65, nobody could have predicted what was to occur a year later.That's the history lesson.Brian Wilson was the visionary behind this record. And his vision shines through brilliantly here, to say the least. The vocal harmonies on this record are otherworldly. There are simply no words to describe just how brilliant 'Pet Sounds' is. 'Wouldn't it Be Nice,' 'Sloop John B,' and 'God Only Knows' are the \"radio hits\" (notice the quotations -- this really isn't a radio-friendly record by any means) from this album, but these are only part of the mystique of 'Pet Sounds.'Listen to the haunting harmonies on 'You Still Believe in Me,' and the creative use of sounds by Brian. A honking horn? Brilliant. Mike Love turns out one of his best vocal performances on 'That's Not Me.' To those who say that Mike Love can't sing, listen to 'That's Not Me' again. His vocals here are emotional and almost flawless, and Brian's vocals in the chorus are also just brilliant. I've always loved the guitar sound in the chorus here as well.The instrumentals are also great. 'Let's Go Away for Awhile' is a dreamy, mysterious piece that features none of The Beach Boys playing on it (this includes Brian Wilson). Wilson arranges it and does it perfectly, but take note that he does not actually participate in the playing. I've always loved the vibraphones on here. This is a neat instrumental. The title track is also quite imaginative, featuring the banging of Coca-Cola cans for percussion. The guitar sound on here is great, as are all of the multiple percussion tracks. This track is extremely complex, and packs a lot into it for a song under 4 minutes.'Here Today' is another fine performance by Love. This is a love song, and it is probably one of the few tracks here (besides the \"radio hits\") that the strictly \"fun-in-the-sun\" Beach Boys fans could relate to. While I'll always prefer Love's vocals on 'That's Not Me,' he still sings wonderfully here, and should be praised for his vocal delivery.And then there are the tearjerkers. 'Don't Talk (Put Your Head On My Shoulder)' is, in my opinion, the most beautiful piece of music ever found on any modern record of any genre. Period. Brian Wilson's vocals here are as close to flawless as one could ever hope to hear. The string arrangements in the middle of the track are perfect, and just suit the track perfectly. Hal Blaine's ever-so-light tapping on cymbal is just perfect for this track. More so than any other track on the record, this song creates a mood. It's slow, romantic, and thought-provoking. This may very well be the most perfect track ever put on tape. And I mean that. 'I Just Wasn't Made for These Times' is also mind-bogglingly beautiful. If you aren't moved by Brian's vocal delivery and the harmonies contained in the middle section, there is something seriously wrong with you (or you are soulless). 'Caroline No' has always been my personal favorite track on the record. While it isn't the most beautiful song on the record, it certainly could be on any other record. Brian's vocals are gut-wrenching and just perfect. You can feel almost every emotion he is trying to convey. You feel the heartbreak in his voice, and it almost stings. But it is also quite beautiful, and the arrangement could not be more perfect.The hits on this record are also perfect. 'Sloop John B' is an old folk song that Bud & Travis had recorded a few years ago, as had The Kingston Trio. Al Jardine had the idea to put a folk song on the record for a balance. Brian, at first reluctant, agreed, and radically altered the track for the record. This song was a radio hit back in 1966, and while I have read that the track is out of place on the record, I could not disagree more. I think the track is perfect here, as it gives the record a lighter track, despite the song's message being rather sad. (This song would have also fit perfectly on 'Summer Days' in my opinion).'Wouldn't it Be Nice' has been played many times, and is still a concert staple for all three current touring lineups of The Beach Boys. Tony Asher's lyrics here are great, and Wilson's voice is also in top shape. This song conveys a message of optimism, and is a perfect love song and the ultimate record opener. 'God Only Knows' was one of Carl Wilson's first vocal performances, and it also remains one of his best. Wilson would perform this song in concert with The Beach Boys right up until his death in February 1998. The backing track is perfect, and the harmonies that Brian, Carl, and Bruce Johnston share on the track are just gorgeous.Lastly, 'I Know There's an Answer' could be interpreted as Brian's take on LSD. It's an interesting track, and it does surprisingly fit on this record. The backing track is extremely complex, featuring a tambourine as its driving rhythm. It's quite interesting. It's not a beauty like some of the other tracks here, but it is certainly a very cool track.The bonus tracks are also neat. 'Trombone Dixie' appears on some additions. Portions of this track (you can call them \"recycled bits\") would later show up on later albums (as backing tracks). 'Hang On to Your Ego' is simply the original version of 'I Know There's an Answer' before Mike Love made Brian Wilson and Tony Asher change the lyrics due to its obvious drug references.The years following 1966 would see some good times ('Good Vibrations,' released at the end of the year would reach #1, the last Beach Boys track to do so in America until 1988) and bad times (the shelving of the 'SMiLE' album until November 2011, Brian Wilson's breakdown, the disappearance of The Beach Boys on the American charts). But one thing is for sure -- 'Pet Sounds' is brilliant. I think it is the greatest album ever made, and it is probably also my favorite album ever made. It is beautiful, moving, interesting, complex, intricate, gorgeous, and flawless. It is very well engineered and very well played (featuring some of the best session musicians in the business, including drummer Hal Blaine, guitarist Barney Kessel and bassist Carol Kaye). This record is a masterpiece that must be owned by all serious music fans.I don't care if you like The Beach Boys or not. If you don't own 'Pet Sounds,' you don't have a collection of music that is worthy of mentioning. Plain and simple. Words cannot describe just how brilliant this record really is. Millions have tried to sing its praises (like I am trying to do now), but there really aren't words adequate enough to describe just how wonderful this record is. This is more than a record -- it is almost a religious experience in its own right.Five stars is not worthy of a record like this. Infinite stars are needed to even *come close* to describing how brilliant this album is. Buy this album IMMEDIATELY if you don't own it already. Buy it and prepare to be blown away by the sheer brilliance that is 'Pet Sounds.'", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "I'm finally writing a review for this", "unixReviewTime": 1323648000, "reviewTime": "12 12, 2011"}

I was, like millions of others, well acquainted with and highly admired the radio favorites Wouldn't It Be Nice and Sloop John B. I often planned to purchase this CD, but I never got around to it until a few months ago.After watching VH1's 100 Greatest Rock-and-Roll Albums of All Time, I witnessed that after the votes of many fans and critics  were tallied, Pet Sounds came in at an astounding Number 3, only behind Nirvana's Nevermind and The Beatles' Revolver, and the additional commentaries provided in the program concerning this release led me to thus conclude that this is definitely a must-have.It is interesting that both The Beach Boys' Pet Sounds and The Beatles' Revolver were almost simultaneously released in 1966. These two works alone illustrated the evolution of synthesizing top-notch songwriting and instrumentation with highly expensive yet very creative musical productions.Lately, as a longtime Beatles fan on one hand and as a person who has come to highly admire the genius of Brian Wilson on the other, I have been comparing Pet Sounds with Revolver. Yes, I think that these albums are equal in greatness and significance. However, I have come to enjoy Pet Sounds a little more. Even Paul McCartney has identified Pet Sounds as one of his all-time favorites and rightfully so.Throughout their careers, the Beach Boys released other works that have come to be noteworthy pop standards but never at the level of this one. In a way Pet Sounds was and is a hallmark of both creative triumph and a series of what-ifs and what-might-have-beens. To me there are now two great mysteries in rock-and-roll history that will forever remain: 1. How successful and well-received would The Beach Boys' Smile, the highly anticipated follow-up that never came to exist, have been? and 2. What if Brian Wilson had a prolific partner within his group just as McCartney had Lennon?", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Not For Just These Times, But For All Times", "unixReviewTime": 988848000, "reviewTime": "05 3, 2001"}

Beach Boys previous music had been mostly about summer, sun, beach and surf but finally Brian Wilson decided to get serious and write songs about more deep and personal issues. This album is considered among the best of all time and it did influent many others in the future. The sound of this album was very unique when it came out and it's a beauty to the ear aswell. Folkish sound with the classic Beach Boys sound singing in voices.After the Beatles \"Rubber Soul\" was released Wilson wanted to reply to that and that's what he did here in his own way ofcourse, the music in the mid 60's had changed alot from the early part. It's difficult to not comapre the two albums though, some people even rate this as the greatest of all albums, agead of Rubber Soul and Abbey Road, I don't. Rubber Soul was the most influentual album for rock music in the 60's but Abbey Road is my favorite album. I don't think we should compare the albums with each others actuall. Beatles is Beatles, and Beach Boys is Beach Boys. The Reason I'll only give 4 stars however is that I feel that there isn't enough variety on this album. Most songs if not all were Wilson pennned and most songs are emotional midtempo or ballads. With Beatles, there were atleast 3 diffrent writers on most albums and the music they made at this time were more contemporary rock infleunted and most songs sounded very diverse aswell and gave them many more hits then \"Pet Sounds\" did, which only had 2 big hits \"Wouldn't it be Good\" and \"Sloop John B\". I'm not trying to take anything away from this album though, it's a very good album on it's own right.There are many good songs here. \"Wouldn't it be Good\" one of a few uptempo songs here and a big hit aswell. \"That's not me\" and \"Don't Talk\" are both good balalds. \"I'm waiting for the Day\" is a midtempo folk rock song. \"Let's Go Away for a While\" is instrumental. \"Sloop John B\" is a midtempo song and also a major hit. \"God only Knows\" is a great ballad, and \"Here Today\" reminds me abit of \"Good Vibration\" based on the musical backround in the beginning and in the end it actually sound very much like \"Eye of the Tiger\" from Survivor. \"Hang on to Your Ego\" is a uptempo song aswell with great instruments.Overall, a great 60's album worth your time, with quite a few top hits that influented the contemporary music back then.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Wilson's great album", "unixReviewTime": 1117843200, "reviewTime": "06 4, 2005"}

Scene", "helpful": [4, 4], "reviewText": "I must admit, as someone who was not a real fan of The Beach Boys, I always considered themselves to be a \"Fun in the Sun\" type of band.  However, as I became intrigued by The Beatles' \"Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hears Club Band\" album, I soon became equally intrigued by The Beach Boys' \"Pet Sounds\".  I soon learned that there was a bit of a rivalry that existed between the Beatles and the Beach Boys' from a creative standpoint.  It turns out that when the Beatles released \"Rubber Soul\", Brian Wilson felt compelled to push himself to the creative max - and the result would be \"Pet Sounds\" - which in turn inspired the Beatles to do \"Sgt Pepper\".  With \"Pet Sounds\", I discovered was an album that wasn't the typical Beach Boys' \"Fun in the Sun\", but an album that would prove to be one of complex instrumentation and be years ahead of its time.  This would be the result of the efforts of Brian Wilson - with some songwriting help from Tony Asher.Wilson incorporates probably one of the widest ranges of instruments that had been heard on any album in the Rock era.  This includes Strings, Woodwinds, Brass, and a variety of percussion and interesting sounds (bicycle bells, dog barking, etc).  If one is to basically compare \"Sgt Pepper\" against \"Pet Sounds\", \"Sgt Pepper\" may have stronger and more catchy lyrics, but Wilson's musical arrangements on \"Pet Sounds\" have the slight edge.  For all practical purposes, Wilson incorporates a four piece orchestra for many parts of this collection.  Two instruments that really stand out on this collection are the use of Tympani Drums and Baritone SaxophoneOne thing that makes this collection so unique is you get two flavors of \"Pet Sounds\".  The first 13 tracks are the original tracks as they were recorded back in 1966 and released in mono.  In 1997, Brian Wilson would take those original masters from 1966 and create a Stereo version of those tracks - which are also included on this collection.  This basically is a win-win for the listener.  I found that I would appreciate the charm and originality of the mono recordings while I could also appreciate how well these tracks sounded when converted to Stereo.  Each version brings a different listening experience. You will hear a little more distortion with the mono version, but that is to be expected.  There is also a bonus track that was not included on the 1966 release called - \"Hang On to Your Ego\".Here is a quick synopsis of the tracks:\"Wouldn't It Be Nice\": This is one of the more popular tracks.  It has the classic Beach Boys' harmonies.  This song is enhanced by the use of Tympani, Saxophones, and Mandolins\"You Still Believe in Me\":  Slight psychedelic feel.  The use of bicycle horns gives this song some charm.  The music from the Harpsichord,  Clarinet, and Tympani are some of the highlights here.\"That's Not Me\": Not a bad song.  Mike Love does a good job on vocals here and Glen Campbell contributes 12 string guitar.\"Don't Talk (Put Your Head on My Shoulder)\":  A gentle song highlighted by gentle vocals by Brian.  Even the use of the Tympani is softer here.  Nice string arrangements here.\"I'm Waiting for the Day\":  This sounds like a cross between psychedelic and Hawaiian sounds.  The Tympanis and Bongos sound great here, but also Ukulele, Flute, and English Horns sound good as well - all will really give this a terrific sound\"Lets Go Away\": I never thought of the Beach Boys as an instrumental group, but \"Pet Sounds\" gives us two instrumentals.  This one has a nice soft classical music feel to it.\"Sloop John B\": Here Brian rearranges a cover of this traditional song.  There is a bit of Doo-Wop in here.  The Baritone Saxophone is used well here.  Brian and Mike do a great job sharing lead vocals.\"God Only Knows\": Paul McCartney still calls this one of the greatest songs he ever heard - and with good reason.  This song is perfection.  Carl Wilson gets the nod to lead the vocals here and doesn't let anyone down.  The French Horns, Baritone Sax, Clarinet, and String Ensemble really help as well.  This song is lyrically very strong and probably the best song done by the Beach Boys.\"I Know There's An Answer\":  Mike and Alan Jardine share vocals here.  Some more strong lyrics.  More of a Doo Wop sound and more terrific Baritone Sax work.\"Here Today\":  Great horn arrangements highlight this song - especially the Baritone Sax\"I Just Wasn't Made For These Times\": Lots of interesting percussion sounds on here.  The Tympani and Baritone Sax stand out here again.\"Pet Sounds\": The title track and another instrumental.  Wilson admits to this having a James Bond psychedelic sound.  More Baritone Sax and Percussions\"Caroline Ho\":  The train sound and the sounds of Brian's dogs barking at the end of this song are most remembered.  There is some nice Ukulele on this song.  Brian does a great job on the lead vocals, but great harmonies by the Beach Boys.\"Hang On To Your Ego\": This is the bonus track.  Baritone Sax is the highlight here again.  However, Brian's vocals might be the strongest of any track on this album.The liner notes are incredible.  You get a short \"letter\" from Brian Wilson about his perspectives on \"Pet Sounds\".  David Leaf has a two terrific write-ups - one is more of a biographical point of view of \"Pet Sounds\" while the other talks about the making of the \"Pet Sounds\" album.  There are track by track notes that include commentary by Brian.  You also get a Sessionography of all of the participating musicians in \"Pet Sounds\".  \"Pet Sounds\" might not be the best selling album in history, but it most certainly merits its place in music history.

The thing is, the music never sounds pretentious or forced; In the hands of Wilson and his endless army of session musicians, these gorgeous musings sound like the natural outcome of songs like \"California Girls\" or \"In My Room.\" It's either genius or something very close to it.And really, there isn't a bad song in the whole bunch: \"Wouldn't It Be Nice\" is an absolutely glorious album opener, a sun-splashed rush of passion and yearning. Brian's (and Mike Love's) vocals are stunning in their emotional directness. \"God Only Knows\" is quieter, but no less poignant- its dizzying swirls of percussion and dreamy vocal harmonies are just plain hypnotic. \"Sloop John B\" (a cover of a classic folk song) has some great harmonies and an infectious melody. \"Let's Go Away For Awhile\" and the title track are a couple of dizzyingly complex instrumentals that are among the dreamiest and most evocative works on the album. \"You Still Believe In Me\" is a stately, dreamy piece of chamber pop, while \"I'm Waiting For The Day\" is a wonderfully optimistic ballad. \"That's Not Me,\" \"I Know There's An Answer,\" and \"I Just Wasn't Made For These Times\" are fantastic evocations of youthful alienation and angst, while \"Here Today\" and \"Caroline No\" are equally effective portraits of lost innocence and love gone sour. There's also \"Don't Talk (Put Your Head On My Shoulder),\" one of the most achingly beautiful ballads ever created. The chorus will make your heart melt.So...yeah. Good stuff.

The Beach Boys were actually singing about reality, and even my reality.The song \"I Just Wasn't Made for These Times\" seemed like it was written just for me.  \"They say I've got brains, but they ain't doing me no good.\" is the story of my life, or at least it seems that way sometimes.The song \"I know There's an Answer\" describes so many people I've encountered in my life.\"Caroline No\" reminded me of a woman I knew in high school who was beautiful and always smiling and happy, but when I met her at  a reunion she had become bitter and her beauty seemed to be gone.  Could she ever get it back?\"That's Not Me\" reminded me of my attempt to succeed in the fast-paced world of consulting when I got out of college.  I had a great job compared to many people, and I worked in some great cities that I never would have seen otherwise, but I discovered the hard way that \"That's Not Me\".These songs and the others are woven together into a pop music symphony that never gets old, (though I will say that I listen to it much more often in the Summer than in the Winter).", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "From hot rods and surf boards to reality", "unixReviewTime": 1145750400, "reviewTime": "04 23, 2006"}

Many people either hated it or didn't understand it, while those who saw the evolution of rock into art realized that this album was helping direct that evolution. As always in everything from movies to books, the difference between art and entertainment became a huge factor in the album's initial commercial lack of success.There was nothing like \"Pet Sounds\" when it came out. Furthermore, the music was very different from what The Beach Boys had done previously. A recipe for commercial disaster. Long time fans of \"Barbara Ann\" and \"Surfing U.S.A.\" wondered what these songs were all about. This stuff just wasn't The Beach Boys they knew. Little did most fans know that The Beach Boys they knew never were The Beach Boys they thought they knew.It wasn't until many years later that the complex relationships and creative conflicts between the members of the group were brought to light, and the discovery that Brian Wilson in particular wanted the group to grow in a more mature direction. \"Pet Sounds\" was a very long step in that direction.We look back on \"Pet Sounds\" from our next millenium perspective and want to say, \"What's the big deal?\" It was a very big deal in 1966. \"Pet Sounds\" and \"Sgt. Pepper\" sparked a whole new revolution in rock music the effect of which can never be fully understood or estimated. These albums were the sound of rock music growing up. However, \"Pet Sounds\" was too alien for the typical public taste at the time, and it flopped.But, other musicians loved it; particularly The Beatles. John and Paul recognized the roots of something great, and were strongly influenced by it. Many other rock and pop musicians have pointed to \"Pet Sounds\" as being a big influence on their music. \"Pet Sounds\" was music as art. \"Sgt. Pepper,\" while also striving for art, also managed to be commercially successful. However, there are songs from \"Sgt. Pepper\" which followed well the artistic path of \"Pet Sounds\" that had their own detractors. Unfortunately not everyone understands art.Listening today, \"Pet Sounds\" is somewhat dated. However, listen to it over and over, and you realize that the music is well done. From our perspective we can look back over 25+ years of rock music and realize that \"Pet Sounds\" was ahead of its time. In all the hysteria of The Beatles, \"Pet Sounds\" got lost.\"Pet Sounds\" is great rock because of what it was when it was released, and who it influenced.Beyond the influence, there are some really great songs on this CD. \"Sloop John B.\" is one of my favorite Beach Boys songs. \"Wouldn't It Be Nice,\" \"That's Not Me,\" \"I Know There's an Answer,\" \"God Only Knows,\" \"Caroline No\"...all very good to great songs. Admittedly somewhat mellow, but beautiful.Should you buy this album? Well, depends on what you like. \"Pet Sounds\" refuses to fit into a nice niche. It's not like what The Beach Boys did before it. It is mellow, but it's not a perfect fit into pop music. If you've heard at least 3 or 4 of the songs above, and like them, then you'll like the rest of the CD. If you haven't heard very much of the CD, then either download samples or borrow a copy. I, on the other hand, may need to purchase another copy, because I think the laser diode is knocking too many molecules off my copy, I play it so much.Note that this album has been reissued and remastered and thus this particular version is now the \"old\" version.

In the Beach Boys he had at his disposal an incredibly skilled vocal group whose voices could blend and mix in the empathetic way that only comes from a family group who have grown up singing, and who were also perfectly capable of recreating the core of the album's sound in live performance.Brian Wilson had worked hard for the group for several years, composing many of the songs, singing lead, arranging the harmony vocals, playing bass guitar and piano and honing his production skills, which were greatly inspired by the work of Phil Spector. He used the same pool of musicians and occasionally the same studio in Hollywood, and like Spector he was an innovator and pioneer who could brilliantly combine unusual pairs or multiples of instruments to create a unique single sound.It all came together on this album, by which time he had retired from the touring group to concentrate on his composing and record-making. The beautiful melodies and the \"pet sounds\" he created were matched by some exquisite lyrics that were written in collaboration with Tony Asher and other writers. Brian Wilson had been inspired by hearing Rubber Soul and was fuelled by an ambition to match it in which he was wholly successful. In turn, Pet Sounds inspired the Beatles to go on to create Sgt Pepper. It was this spirit of competitive creativity that led to his unfortunate burn out during the creation of Smile, his response to Sgt Pepper.Although not exactly a concept album, everything was recorded specifically for the album apart from the traditional song Sloop John B, which had already been released as a single and was included on the insistence of the record company. It does not sound too out of place. The first single from the album was the heartfelt God Only Knows (What I'd Do Without You). This got to number 2 in the UK, but suffered in America from lack of radio exposure by nervous radio stations, who began playing the flipside instead. This resulted in Wouldn't It Be Nice, surely an A-side in its own right anyway, reaching the US Top Ten.The title song Pet Sounds is an instrumental that was originally called Run James Run, inspired by James Bond, and when heard with this in mind takes on a whole new meaning for the listener. The closing track, Caroline No, ends with more pet sounds: Brian's puppies Banana and Louie barking as the song fades. This had also come out on a single before the release of Pet Sounds, but under the name Brian Wilson, and without the beagle and weimaraner or other sound effects.Of course, the original album already resides on everyone's CD shelf in mono. Brian Wilson was deaf in one ear and so preferred to work monaurally, again like Phil Spector. He also felt that he could present the sound to the listener in exactly the way he wished, without interference from any stereophonically knob-twiddling listener.However, a stereo edition was produced and engineered by Mark Linett in 1997 for the Pet Sounds box set, created under the close supervision of Brian Wilson himself, and this edition follows the original album with this scrupulously remixed true stereo version. Not only are these versions often slightly longer, the additional clarity afforded by the sound separation adds a whole new dimension to hearing them, and takes away absolutely nothing. Technological improvements since 1997 have meant that the new stereo mix of Wouldn't It Be Nice on this edition is less different from the original mono mix than on the box set", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Surely one of the great albums of all time", "unixReviewTime": 1143417600, "reviewTime": "03 27, 2006"}

However,what's truly difficult is to consider those albums to sound as fresh and innovative as they were at the time of their release. Pet Sounds, however, makes it seem like the easiest task in the world. This is the case because, superficially, Pet Sounds is the first and main point of reference for the wide scope of innovations to come out of 60s' pop. It seems everything the 60s' had to offer to pop music were synthesized within the album; from the innovations of earlier craftsmen like Phil Spector and Burt Bacharach, the growth of the Baroque Pop aesthetic, and the California sunshine scene, all the way to the upcoming of Sgt. Pepper, late 60s' American psychedelia, and the Chamber/Twee Pop revival in the 1990s' (to which this album was heralded as a rosetta stone).Sure, to must pundits this is all very possible to point out without even listening to the album. But once you get to listen to it, with the first listen it sounds as nothing The Beach Boys had ever done (or would do again). To be blunt, the album easily trashes out the Boys' entire previous catalogue, making it seem as if nothing was even listenable before Pet Sounds. This is of course not the case, the point being that the album is at such an elevated high from the (already good) albums of the rest of their catalogue.Thats also not to say that this is a different style than their previous albums, its just that every element of the Boys' music was not perfected up until Pet Sounds. Their classic vocal harmonies are present; but Wilson multi-layers them into angelical synchronization. The pop hooks are still there; but Wilson adorns them with subtle juxtapositions of varied orchestrations (within the same song). The teenage melodramatic mood? Well in Pet Sounds it is transformed into timeless yearns for love, reciprocation, and meaning. See the pattern that emerges?The one thing thats truly radical from the Boys' previous inputs, and arguably what gives Pet Sounds its sublimity, is the instrumentation. No longer are the Boys' reliant on just blues chord progression piano, surf-like guitar hooks and saxophone here and there. This time, Wilson is able to integrate the grandeur of his best songs (like California Girls and Don't Worry Baby) into a full fledged album. And not only that, he uses an full set orchestra to conceive it. This is not just your typical strings and brass however; Wilson goes all the way with timpani, french horns, vibraphone and harpsichord, among others. He even goes beyond orchestral instruments and brings in ukuleles, hammond organs, hawaiian percussion, accordion, hell you name it! Its just like one critic pointed out, the singles from Pet Sounds where the only time the Boys' met commercial success while being endlessly experimental.The songs are as varied as the instrumentation as well. You have the sunshine-like opening of \"Wouldn't It Be Nice\", the hauntingly sad \"Don't Talk\", the superficial fun of \"Sloop John B.\" and the anthemic \"God Only Knows\", just to mention a few examples. Hell, there are even a couple of instrumental tracks a-la Martin Denny! Be certain of one thing, there are NO high points and low points in this album, it all flows majestically like vintage wine from beginning to end.Even though Pet Sounds is a mono recording (stereo listeners don't stop reading YET), Brian Wilson unmistakably manages the production output into an elaborate, wall-of-sound-alike work. That is to say, it is essentially mono, but the recording process of the orchestrations are in no way lessened. To be honest, I thought at first that it was a stereo recording, because I can notice the difference with some of the Boys' previous records, in which the instrumentation could sometimes be unbearably washed up. And its also a bona-fide experience to listen to it in mono, as Brian intended it to be. However if you're really into stereo, there is a stereo version of the album included (past the bonus track \"Hang On To Your Ego\").To conclude, I believe that if you're going to buy just one 60s' pop album in your life then let Pet Sounds be that choice. I mean sure, you could pick up one of their much rivaled Beatles albums, but not even Sgt. Pepper matches the ornamental beauty of Pet Sounds, The Beach Boys one true magnum opus...although I am yet to listen to The Smile Sessions, so who knows if there's a contender...", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Mr. lifeguard, there's a goat on the beach...", "unixReviewTime": 1328745600, "reviewTime": "02 9, 2012"}

And, there is that here, in the joyous strains of  &quot;Wouldn't It Be Nice&quot; (with probably one of the most famous  opening drumbeats in pop history), and &quot;You Still Believe in Me&quot;,  but there's also a lot of longing, loneliness, questioning and  disappointment between the grooves, all complimented wonderfully by the  atmospheric and ethereal arrangements played mainly by Brian and session  musicians.  This is probably one of the first and finest examples of a true  studio creation--a concept album where all of the tracks seem of a piece.

Maybe it doesn't come through just reading it, but that's  about as close to poetry pop music comes in my opinion--the second verse  does the same trick (even better).

The warm sun and ocean breeze are invigorating. The white seagulls circle overhead (watch out!), and I have been busy all afternoon trying to build a summer sand castle for myself meanwhile sweating to death in this Seer's cape. They said the fabric breathed and would be good in all temperatures. They lied. And, aside from all that, just when I get the sand castle to a stately form, some freckle-faced, red-headed bratty boy comes around and knocks it down. I threatened to report him to The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Seers, however, an ice cream cone made him go away. Dealing with Guido has made me very adept in any situation. Now if only the tides would stop being a threat. Ah well..........Anyway, I am in the perfect setting to examine the rewards of \"Pet Sounds\" by the Beach Boys. Much has been written about this seminal album. And why not? It consistently ranks in the top 10 pop-rock albums of all time. And rightly so if you ask me.Of course, it wasn't greeted ethusiastically when it came out. At least not as much as their prior hits. Brian Wilson took the hit most of all. Probably unjustly. But time has proven that it was the right move and the right time. To most, perhaps a little early and maybe they would say the wrong time. But I would have to disagree with that. Brian was ahead of everything on the scene at that time. He saw that the music was changing. Plus, artistically, you can not stay in the same place. Artistry needs real growth. Meanwhile, the other Beach Boys needed more hits- and this is why the chasm happened.But, lets get into this a little more. The Beach Boys were (and still are) the ultimate summer group. Songs about California Girls, fast cars, high school life, requited love, and teen angst, angst, angst.  These songs were incredibly successful. But Brian knew that, as he got older, his audience were also doing the same thing. He wanted to try a new direction and add some sophistication. Looking back to 1966, this album is a monumental achievement- and remains so until this day. Sure, some may downplay the importance of this recording, however, that cannot eliminate the fact that it was a monumental change that influenced the musical landscape at that time forever. It is essential, and one of the very best.But, getting to the main point. Brian Wilson was moving towards greater musical compostion and more adult and inner emotions on record. This was a mega step- and quite a risk at the same time. Most of the music is lush, well thought out, and instruments used precisely to get the right nuances that bounced around in his mind. Certainly the songs are confessional, i.e; \"You Still Believe in Me\", emotional, i.e, \"That's Not Me\", \"I'm Waiting for the Day\", and quiet, heartfelt romance, i.e; \"Don't Talk (Put Your Head on my Shoulder)\".  One must, of course, listen to all the colours and passages in this music. All these songs have a way of revealing certain moods that marry the music perfectly. Beautiful lilting breaks, shifting meter, an array of musical instruments heretofore never thought of in the pop-rock genre. Excellent.And songs? We are treated to different, but essential, gratuitous hits with \"Wouldn't It Be Nice\" and \"Sloop John B\". But more than this, Brian gives us 2 more considerable high standard gems. Yes. We get to \"God Only Knows\" which I nominate as the most beautiful song ever written in the course of popular music. Grandiose, glorious- I am fairly convinced that a higher power is somehow behind this remarkable song. Sweet, yearning, beautiful beyond compare. Angelic vocals as well. If anyone doubts Brian Wilson's genius, have them look to this song. Absolutely the highest gem. Then we get to the wispful \"Caroline No\". Brian reflects upon how time can change a relationship. He looks back to a time when his love was new and exciting and wonders why she changed. \"Where is the girl I used to know\"? He hurts badly from the change and yearns for a return to a satisfying relationship, knowing full well that it has changed forever. Listen to the end. A train in the distance, approaching at a rapid pace, getting louder, and then quickly passing by. A dog barks in the distance-urging its return. But it gone and then silence. What an incredible conveyence of mood this is for the ending. Superb.In a way, the outtake of \"I know There's an Answer\" entitled \"Hold On to Your Ego\" to me, conveys the frustration Brian was going through in order to have the other members of the group in compliance with his new direction. But he knows he's alone and he knows that he's \"going to lose the fight\". Well, he may have lost it to them- however- he won the classic album. And we are all so much better that he did.Now, I must go and make sure that kid isn't planning some new attack on my new home. I don't want to lose the fight anymore than Brian does.In conclusion- a classic and a must have in any considerable music collection.Goats say \"feed me\", Seers say \"read me\". -- yours, Metamorpho", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Wouldn't It Be Nice to Live Together, in the Kind of World Where We Belong?", "unixReviewTime": 1184371200, "reviewTime": "07 14, 2007"}

Hmmm...many of the tracks seem overly-sweetened to these ears, especially \"You Still Believe In Me\", \"I'm Waiting For The Day\", \"Here Today\"...the chamber orchestration applied to \"God Only Knows\" still works, largely because the melody is so timeless; along with \"Wouldn't It Be Nice\", the title track and \"Caroline No\" it's the best thing on the disc.  Wilson's lyrics are OK and certainly more sophisticated than anything The Beach Boys and most other pop acts were capable of in the spring of '66, but even the best here (\"I Just Wasn't Made For These Times\", \"Caroline No\") are written from an overly-sentimental perspective.  Oddly enough, though, I enjoy \"Don't Talk\" in spite of--or maybe even because--it's a simple romantic ballad (the repetition of the chorus at the end creeps up on me and sends shivers down the spine).\"Pet Sounds\" never *truly* grabbed me until I heard the stereo version prepared for the box set, and which is included here.

Their celebrations of sun, surfing, and hot-rodding were too removed from my own experience. It wasn't until I got older that I appreciated them. Songs that had once sounded frivolous suddenly revealed multiple layers of emotions which had previously eluded me.Mind you, that wasn't true of every Beach Boys song. But classics like \"Surfer Girl\" and \"Don't Worry Baby\" were wistful and beautiful evocations of love and longing - both questioning and reassuring.Brian Wilson then outdid himself with his compositions for the landmark 1966 album \"Pet Sounds\" - their apex and finest achievement - and arguably the greatest record ever released by an American band. Paul McCartney has said that if you haven't heard it, your musical education isn't complete. He further said it inspired the Beatles to make \"Sgt. Pepper\". I don't really hear \"Pet Sounds\" influence on that record, but I do on \"Abbey Road\" - especially on tracks like \"Because\" and \"Here Comes The Sun King\".This CD contains the full album in mono and stereo. Wilson's musical and vocal arrangements still sound stunning to this day. If for any reason you've resisted buying this, you shouldn't. At the very minimum, any serious music fan should own \"Pet Sounds\" and a good collection of their hits such as \"Sounds Of Summer\" (2003).Wilson's solo career has also been of interest. \"Brian Wilson\" (1988) was a good one. So was the belatedly completed \"Smile\" (2004), which was originally intended as the follow-up to \"Pet Sounds\" - wherein he proved himself to be a latter-day Gershwin. \"Smile\" collaborator Van Dyke Parks and Wilson had previously released the excellent \"Orange Crate Art\" (1995). Recently, Wilson issued \"That Lucky Old Sun\" (2008), another innovative song suite in the style of \"Smile\" - and it's fine. All are highly recommended.Whether you live in California or not, don't miss out on the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Here Comes The Sun King", "unixReviewTime": 1223596800, "reviewTime": "10 10, 2008"}

Exaggerations and hyperbolas are the standard in Amazon reviews, but everything I say about this release is both an accurate description and a heartfelt love.Originally a response to The Beatles' RUBBER SOUL, not only does PET SOUNDS proves Brian Wilson head and shoulders above even The Beatles (if only for one album), he quite beautifully  demonstrates what can be achieved by the human spirit.  Musically ceaselessly inventive, with layers and layers of all sorts of instruments and even a dog and a train.  However, music itself does not support the hype I've said about the album.Here's what does: Brian Wilson's collaboration with Tony Asher, who wrote most of the lyrics for the album.  Asher easily proves himself an incredible lyricist and the best collaborator for Wilson's vision.  What makes PET SOUNDS so great is all the songs add to a cohesion of both emotion, spirituality, and searching for the answer that The Beatles never captured (and maintained) throughout an entire album, and only distantly felt (compared to this; in their own right, both albums I am about to cite are intense) in Radiohead's OK COMPUTER and Pink Floyd's DARK SIDE OF THE MOON.This is the genius of PET SOUNDS.  It captures a stage in which we evolve the most: youth.  Not only does it capture it, PET SOUNDS recreates this stage and makes it wonderfully relevant to our own lives, no matter how far from youth one is.  Brian Wilson and Tony Asher chart a young man's voyage through his youth.  In only 35 minutes, this musical journey becomes both real and tangible, becoming almost like a novel in its characters' complexity.  While it can be argued that this is only a collection of songs, that strips away much of the beauty and incredible vision that it took to make this album.Listening to PET SOUNDS is like watching your life unfold: going through romantic idealisation to crushing heartbreak, searching for God and your relation to Him, and a struggle to establish who you are and what you stand for.While the dominant motif is romance, you can take this as an allegory or analogy for anything a person truly loves and the trials and tribulations one will encounter in a pursuing this love.  This facet is also what makes PET SOUNDS so accomplished and beautiful: it captures the pain of love, whatever that love is, whether it be in romance, which PET SOUNDS chose as its dominant landscape, or any other true love which is accessible to humanity.Every teenager should discover the truths on this album, for it will greatly aid him/her in their own love lives.  PET SOUNDS, because of the ascetic environment in which it responded too (music largely simple with all these impossible romantic dreams, ala &quot;I Want To Hold Your Hand,&quot; etc), much of PET SOUNDS deals with romantic turmoil.  The opening track, &quot;Wouldn't It Be Nice,&quot; shows the young man in a very simple, wholly naive belief about love and relations to the opposite sex.  Then Wilson and Asher gives us a study of this young man journeying from idealisation to crushing lost.  The unnamed &quot;I&quot; becomes so real by the end of PET SOUNDS that, listening to the album in its entirety, &quot;Caroline No&quot; is so painfully intense after watching him struggle through so many things in his own life.  Because of the incredible buildup, this is the single most powerful ending to any work of art, let alone music, that I have experienced.When I said &quot;study&quot;, one may think of a dry, academic approach that only deadens what you really have an interest in and truly love.  Have no fear.  When you listen to this, you are constantly connecting to this person (or persons, even) that PET SOUNDS deals with (the unnamed &quot;I&quot;).  Anyone who will truly allow themselves to be open to this will find much of their own probing of life here, and generally one cannot help but connect and identify with the young man in his quest for identity and a solution to life's ever-appearing questions.Before I end this review, to clear up my own viewpoint of Beatles records in relation to this, the three mid-period albums (RUBBER SOUL, REVOLVER, and SGT. PEPPER), are some of the best albums ever made but simply cannot answer to PET SOUNDS, The Beach Boys only truly significant album.  RUBBER SOUL is brilliant but does not add up to any cohesiave whole as this does.  Wilson wanted to outdo The Beatles after hearing RUBBER SOUL, and in my opinion he did.  REVOLVER, one of rock's most celebrated LPs, again lacks the cohesion to that is required to top PET SOUNDS.  SGT. PEPPER, which, after Wilson heard it, felt crushed and defeated and left one of rock's most enduring &quot;What If?'s&quot; by abandoning SMILE, the follow up to PET SOUNDS which was never finished, let alone released.  While historically the most important LP we have, SGT. PEPPER is more an exercise in band psychology to truly stretch across and become the achievement PET SOUNDS is.  Paul McCartney allowed himself the luxury of pretending to be in Sgt. Pepper's band, and the only importance the &quot;concept&quot; of PEPPER had was freeing McCartney up and getting the band away from their bubble-gum identity.  While it has a tremendous closing, there is no magnificent buildup to what is an already powerful conclusion.I consider PET SOUNDS, the one piece of art from music, that should enter the classical canon of twentieth century art.  Its importance and relevance to humanity cannot be overstated, and is one of art's best epiphanies and expression of human pain, searching, faith, and endurance.AS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED AS POSSIBLE!!!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Pure Pop Epiphany -- One of the century's best!", "unixReviewTime": 1003536000, "reviewTime": "10 20, 2001"}

I totally understand that it was a landmark album and changed the way music was recorded and the way it could sound, but other then the production I don't get it. Yes it inspired Srg. Pepper by the Beatles but so what, so did Freak Out! by Frank Zappa and The Mothers Of Invention and that doesn't get half the acclaim this does.I think 'God Only Knows' is a great song....lyrically that is. Music wise I do feel the band could have done better. The melody is smooth as ice though. 'Wouldn't It Be Nice' is hands down one of the greatest pop songs of all time, no debate, I would even fight someone who dare says a bad thing about that tune. I must say though that 'Sloop John B' could have been better. The title track is really awful to my ears. 'Here Today' was misguided.

The loss of innocence. The world was changing fast in the 1960s, and The Beach Boys represented good, clean and carefree fun to a lot of people.

With these two 1965 lps Brian Wilson and the Beach Boys were trying to create a new sound that at the time no other rock group had ever created. In December 1965 after Brian Wilson had just heard the Beatles \"Rubbersoul\", a statement album from the fab four, implying that the whole album should be counted as the hit, not just a single or two off the album and the rest just filler. Brian was amazed at the simularities between the just released \"Rubbersoul\" and The Beach Boys earlier 1965 releases \"Today\" and \"Summer Days and Summer nights\". Brian would say \"I want to make a record just like that, but I want to make it better!\"Brians competitive fires were stoked to compete with the Beatles. And what Brian Wilson and the Beach Boys created blew the Beatles right out of the water and rest was history. In fact the Beach Boys were so worried about Pet Sounds being accepted by Capital records they were prepared  to be told to \"go back to the studio and make a friendly top forty record but defenintly please nothing like Pet Sounds\". Capital Records were not so sure how the public would accept this new sound. An incredible early psychedelic recording released May 16,1966 which influenced the Beatles 1967 Sgt.Pepper so much that George Martin has stated \"if it were'nt for Pet Sounds Sgt. Pepper would not have been created\". Pretty strong words from Sir George who helped produce the worlds greatest rock bands music. Believe me when the Beatles heard Pet Sounds their jaws dropped with envy and anger.1966 was a very musically transitional year for both the Beatles and the Beach Boys. At this time on Aug.5th 1966 the Beatles released their counter shot to Pet Sounds with their masterpiece \"Revolver\". Many rockologists and Beatle fans alike consider Revolver to be a better recording than Sgt.Pepper, of course it will always be debatable and an ongoing endless conversation. The Beach Boys were to add an exclamation point to Pet Sounds in october 1966 as the Beach Boys unleashed their pschyedelic masterpiece \"Good Vibrations\" just a few months before the Beatles started their Sgt. Pepper recording sessions.The Beatles were enjoying success with Revolver and captured some of the new pschyedelic sound with Revolvers release. Even with the success of Revolver, the release of Good Vibrations defined more of the psychedelic sound in rock music in the fall of 1966 than Revolver did and really got the Beatles crazy with envy, and created a real urgency for the Beatles to get back to Abbey Road studios to outdue their well armed  rivals. The Beach Boys never approached the success of the Beatles due partly if not all to Brian Wilsons bad habits of over indulgance, but Pet Sounds  really made the psychedelic  era sound and influenced the Beatles Sgt Pepper. As the song says God only knows what the Beach boys could have done post Pet Sounds, if it were'nt for Brians over indulgance in bad habits, will never know. Pet sounds was recorded while Brian had these bad habits but that is what helped Pet Sounds sound unique, Brian let these bad habits get the better of him post Pet Sounds.Pet Sounds was not a commercial success when released, but clearly got the attention of many music artist including classical composer Leonard Bernstien, as their minds were just blown away by it. I listen to both Sgt. Pepper and Pet Sounds  and there is some really eerie simularities, besides the instrumentation between the two, on Pet Sounds after \"Caroline No\" the last song on the recording you hear a trolly and a dog barking and than a train with its horn going off and a dog barking while and after the train passes. On Sgt. Pepper you hear barn animals, possibly Pet Sounds influenced and on Magical Mystery Tour you hear a train with its horn just before going into Pennylane. Pink Floyd would use animals sounds in their 1970s work, 1970 \"Atom Heart Mother\" including a cow on the cover of the lp. Pink Floyd in 1976 released an album called Animals and even used giant inflatable pigs on their Animals tour stage show, I wonder if Pet Sounds had anything to due with that?Pet sounds caused the Beatles to disappear into Abbey Road for 6-8 months to make Sgt. Pepper. To make Sgt. Pepper better than Pet Sounds and Good Vibrations. Because of this Sgt. Pepper is the yardstick to measure every rock recording from past, present and future. The Beatles also had the greatest record producer of all time on their side Sir George Martin.John Lennon, Paul McCartney, Sir George Martin vs. Brian Wilson. Brian Wilson was on his own and had no real help, even though the remaining Beach Boys had some creative, musical skills. The one thing I will give the Beach Boys over the Beatles is that they had better technology in the recording studio than the Beatles at Abbey Road. I respect the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson (Tony Asher) as a song writer and music creator. In my opinion the Beach Boys Pet Sounds set up the pschycodelic era, a really important era in rock history that even the Beatles and most every other rock band during the psychedelic era copied Pet Sounds in some form. I like having both versions of Pet Sounds, Mono so you could hear how it sounded in 1966 and stereo because you could hear different instruments that you cant hear in mono.I like the stereo version better because I am just used to stereo recordings, but I still like to listen to the mono version and go back to 1966. The 5.1 stereo sound is  mind boggeling and must be heard on your theatre system, you will not beleive Pet Sounds could sound this incredible. Every song on Pet Sounds is a an early psychedelic journey into the start of the most important era in rock history. Pet Sounds started the most Important era in rock history the Psychedelic Era. I recommend Pet Sounds to any music lover this recording truly set the standard as definetly one of the greatest most influential rock recordings ever created.This cd mono and stereo sounds pristine and brilliantly remastered. The miniature booklet supplied with this 40th anniversary edition cd is extremely informative and the dvd is an incredible look into this historical facinating recording. Pet Sounds is a very influential and timeless recording.Pet Sounds is the blueprint for the entire psychodelic 1960s, early 1970s, which the Beatles and many rock groups of the time used the Pet Sounds blueprint to mold and create their own music during this time. If you the reader wish to get more into Pet Sounds you should look into purchasingThe Pet Sounds Sessions. You will with this four cd box set see how genius Brian Wilson constructs his 1966 masterpiece. If Pet sounds Sessions is to overkill you will be making the right choice just sticking to this fortieth anniversary edition release.............................", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "ON 5/16/66 PET SOUNDS STARTED THE PSYCHEDELIC 1960S....THE BEACH BOYS MASTERPIECE,  GOD ONLY KNOWS.................", "unixReviewTime": 1167955200, "reviewTime": "01 5, 2007"}

But the reason why it has garnered so much critical attention is that it truly one of the most original and groundbreaking albums in rock history.  Brian Wilson had spent the previous few years writing and producing magnificent singles, but had yet made a truly great album.  Spurred on by The Beatles' Rubber Soul and his idol, Phil Spector, Mr. Wilson set about to make an album that raised the bar on what could be achieved on a pop album.  He succeeded on every level.  Pet Sounds is one of the most literate, intricate and lavishly produced albums ever released.  The other band members were limited to just providing vocals on the album as Mr. Wilson employed studio musicians to provide the music.  Despite this fact, the band never sounded better as they provide the luscious harmonies that make the songs practically float out of your speakers.  The songs were no longer about surfing and cars, but about more mature relationships and growing up.  &quot;Wouldn't Be Nice&quot; is a beautiful song about wanting to get married that hit number 8 on the charts, &quot;You Still Believe In Me&quot; is an airy number about a woman standing by her man, &quot;Don't Talk (Put Your Head On My Shoulder)&quot; is another gorgeous melody and &quot;Sloop John B&quot; is a traditional song that was the album's biggest hit peaking at number 2.  &quot;I Just Wasn't Made For These Times&quot; is another brilliant introspective number from Brian Wilson and &quot;Caroline No&quot; is a beautiful ballad that closes the original album out and was actually released as solo recording by Mr. Wilson.  &quot;God Only Knows&quot; is perhaps the most heartbreakingly beautiful song the band has ever recorded and is the essence of the album.  Carl Wilson gives his hands down best lead vocal and the song is a virtual symphony.  Pet Sounds was not a big hit in the US, peaking at number 10, as Americans wanted songs about sun and fun in the sun.

If this album were produced today in 2004, we would marvel at the sonic quality, the production magic, the textural intricacy, and the instrumental details.  That it was done in 1966 is mind-boggling.  With PET SOUNDS, Brian Wilson's name was forever etched in the pantheon of great composers; and like fine wine, this album just seems to get better with age.  The lyrics combine wide-eyed innocence with a knowing pathos that makes each song quite moving.  The melodies are achingly gorgeous and the harmonies are positively celestial.  Wilson's choice of instrumentation is as bold as it is broad; chimes and sleigh bells and woodwinds and brass and strings augment the traditional bass-drum-guitar-keyboard sound, giving PET SOUNDS a lushness that has seldom, if ever, been matched.  \"Wouldn't it be Nice\" is a joyous romp that launches PET SOUNDS on a very high, longing note.  Dazzling harmonies highlight the ballad \"You Still Believe in Me\" before the band swings into the highly personal, uptempo \"That's Not Me.\"  Brian Wilson's romantic \"Don't Talk (Put Your Head on My Shoulder)\" is amazingly intimate, and then the mood shifts once more for a romp with \"I'm Waiting for the Day.\"  The jazzy instrumental \"Let's Go Away for Awhile\" leads into one of the Beach Boys' most beloved story songs, \"Sloop John B,\" a folky, jaunty-sounding song that tells a very sad and disturbing tale. If PET SOUNDS is arguably the best album of the past 50 years, then \"God Only Knows\" is arguably the best song.  Take a stunningly beautiful melody, overlay it with instantly relatable and honest lyrics and a bracingly innocent vocal performance filled with longing and the sweet pain that only love can bring...and then wrap it in some of the lushest arranging and instrumentation ever heard on record...and you have a song that is an enduring and beloved classic.  Confession and hope imbue the next track, \"I Know There's An Answer\" with a positive, refreshing sense of survival...made all the more poignant now knowing Brian's state of mind when he was working on PET SOUNDS and the subsequent SMILE.  The tempo picks up again for \"Here Today,\" before cooling back down again for the heartbreaking \"I Just Wasn't Made for These Times,\" a song destined to be Brian Wilson's epitaph.  The title track is a cool, exotic instrumental that sounds like a surf tune arranged and orchestrated by Nelson Riddle.  With \"Caroline, No\" Brian Wilson takes a very simple line, \"Where did your long hair go?\" and spins it into a metaphor for lost innocence in life, in relationships, and indeed, for an entire generation.  One finds themselves overusing the word \"poignant\" to describe songs on PET SOUNDS but is certainly is an apt word...especially for \"Caroline, No\".  The bonus track, \"Hang On to Your Ego,\" is an alternate take for \"I Know There's An Answer,\" and it is enlightening when juxtaposed with the final version.  Because of it's cohesiveness musically and thematically, PET SOUNDS is one of those few CDs that virtually demands to be listened to, uninterrupted, from start to finish every time.  Give it a spin and let it grow on you...I used to love PET SOUNDS, but now, I consider it an absolutely indespensible part of my CD collection.

(Then again, it wasn't a certified million seller until April 2000, so I've read.) How was it possible? Add my name to the endless list of people who thought the Beach Boys were a wimpy, horrible band that only American teenagers of the 1960s could like, only to discover that Pet Sounds is superb. Or maybe we love it because it's not really a Beach Boys album, it's a Brian Wilson album.Despite my reservations, I finally picked it up a year ago (about April 2000, come to think of it!) and was floored. It's a gem from start to finish, pretty much.'Wouldn't It Be Nice' and the gorgeous 'God Only Knows' are familiar to even non-fans like me, but there are quality songs all over the place, in particular 'I Just Wasn't Made For These Times'. The record would have been improved by omitting 'Sloop John B.', as Brian wished, but, as the suits told him, hey, we gotta have a hit song, right? The song is okay but it just doesn't fit here. Now, Good Vibrations ... oh, well.Everything you've read about Wilson's production is true. It's brilliant and sometimes over-the-top. The vocals are stunning. But I do not go along with the universal line that the lyrics here are anything special. There are some good ones, and they're a helluva lot better than previous BB material, but Dylan had nothing to fear.I can't believe that only 24 people have reviewed this disc so far. It's probably a manifestation of the phenomenon that has surrounded Pet Sounds from the start: it's better thought of in England (a Mojo poll recently nominated it the planet's No.1 album) than it is in the US.

To call it the best pop album ever is an understatement, and also a little misleading. This music is beyond categorization as &quot;pop&quot;-- it's simply brilliant, idiosyncratic MUSIC. That being said, there is nothing in the history of recorded music that even touches the sheer genius of this record. Every microsecond of sound is so carefully considered and perfectly arranged that the result is the most emotionally touching collection of songs you'll ever hear. It is impossible to overrate Pet Sounds. It is unlike anything that came before or after. Nothing in the Beatles' over-hyped catalog even comes close-- and anything that might be in the same general proximity is rightly credited more to George Martin's production than the &quot;Fab Four&quot;. Remember, Pet Sounds is the work of one singular musical imagination-- Brian uses the Boys as &quot;instruments&quot;-- composed, arranged, produced/assembled, dreamed as a coherent whole.This album should be heard by EVERYONE, whatever you believe your musical to be. It is one of the great works of Western Civilization for us to study, consider and enjoy. Beyond essential.This version offers the original Mono mix as well as a new Stereo mix. Obviously,it should be heard in the original Mono to be fully appreciated, but I'll be the first to admit the Stereo is REALLY good, offering a sense of spaciousness and natural sound that is hard to criticize. It's not a substitute for the original, but a great addendum. Honestly, the best version is the DCC &quot;gold&quot; disc which is mastered with such attention to detail that it has an almost intangible like-like quality not even present on the original LP.

But I've always been a big BBoys fan. &quot;God Only Knows&quot; is among the finest compositions ever, and, along with a handful of Brian's songs,deserves inclusion in the 20th Century canon, along with Gershwin's and Kern's best,etc. I heard a beautiful recording of this by a Canadian children's choir,which sounds better than the BBoys.Beyond this, most the tunes seem to be about late adolescent angst,high production value or not. As one gets into the Middle Years of life, can anyone really praise &quot;Wouldn't it be Nice&quot;, or &quot;Caroline No&quot; to the Sky? They remind me of whining choir boys,stretching to hit a note. Yes, Brian was looking for a new sound at the time,but on this record there is almost none of the fun and whimsy so obvious in their earlier work. It's true they were still very young (mid- 20's probably) when they did PET SOUNDS..The songs with Mike singing the lead come off better, like &quot;I Know there's an Answer&quot;, &quot;Here Today&quot;, and &quot;I'm Waiting for the Day&quot;, with the high pitched Wilson brothers doing the backgrounds. Along with their own SURFS UP, this is among the great late 60's, early 70's  pop/rock albums. Yes, it's up there with the best of the Beatles, Simon and Garfunkel,and the Byrds.

Sultry vocals and harmonies, great songwriting about things that most people, in the U.S. in particular, could understand and relate to, being on the beach, cars and girls.  However, Brian began to want to explore more in music and draw on the rich and outstanding wellspring of musical genius he had within him.  This began to eat him up inside as the record label and those within his own band, Mike Love in particular, couldn't nor wouldn't allow themselves to understand.  I've heard many reasons for his nervous breakdowns but I believe this to be the catalyst.This was a man who was hearing wonderful musical themes in his head and was not being allowed the time, space and creative freedom to explore and bring these themes into fruition.  On top of that, the \"British Invasion\" was in full swing and those artists and bands were bringing a fresh perspective on music, both it's recording and production, to the world as well as the \"Motown Sound\" topping the charts with one great artist after another.  Fate typically does things when least expected and fate saw an exhausted Wilson being home recuperating from his breakdown at just the time the \"Rubber Soul\" album was being released by the Beatles.  It would be the album that helped to validate the direction Wilson was feeling his music and that of The Beach Boys should be going.He found his creative \"second wind\" and with the help of friend and lyricist Tony Asher, he begin to compose, write, produce and record the songs that would become \"Pet Sounds.\"  It was truly an ambitious project and one that would change the face of not just rock music but music in general forever.  When his fellow band mates returned off of the remainder of the tour Brian had left, he had basically the entire project completed except for the vocals.  Once the other members, along with Brian, laid down their gorgeous vocals which, as usual, were one of the many strengths of the album, they had completed a true game changer and neither they nor the music world would be the same.  This album would inspire a whole host of artists to change their entire perspective on how songs should be both written and recorded.Paul McCartney took a copy to John Lennon and they listened to it over and over again until it became engrained in their thought processes.  George Martin, their brilliant producer, also was listening to the album and it was now the catalyst for what would become \"Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.\"  Funny how fate and destiny work, isn't it?  Bravo to you Mr. Brian Wilson, I recently listened to this album from beginning to end and marveled at what was produced.  You and Mr. Asher created a masterpiece that truly changed the music world and more importantly, validated your true genius.P.S. Here's what others were saying about the album and Brian Wilson:Eric Clapton stated that \"All of us, Ginger Baker, Jack Bruce and I consider Pet Sounds to be one of the greatest pop LPs to ever be released. It encompasses everything that's ever knocked me out and rolled it all into one.\"Elton John has said of the album, \"For me to say that I was enthralled would be an understatement. I had never heard such magical sounds, so amazingly recorded. It undoubtedly changed the way that I, and countless others, approached recording. It is a timeless and amazing recording of incredible genius and beauty.\"Beatles producer George Martin stated that \"Without Pet Sounds, Sgt. Pepper wouldn't have happened... Pepper was an attempt to equal Pet Sounds.\"Paul McCartney has said \"It was Pet Sounds that blew me out of the water. I love the album so much. I've just bought my kids each a copy of it for their education in life. I figure no one is educated musically 'til they've heard that album. I love the orchestra, the arrangements. It may be going overboard to say it's the classic of the century, but to me, it certainly is a total, classic record that is unbeatable in many ways. I've often played Pet Sounds and cried.  I played it to John [Lennon] so much that it would be difficult for him to escape the influence, it was the record of the time.  The thing that really made me sit up and take notice was the bass lines and also, putting melodies in the bass line.  That I think was probably the big influence that set me thinking when we recorded Pepper, it set me off on a period I had then for a couple of years of nearly always writing quite melodic bass lines.  \"God Only Knows\" is a big favourite of mine, very emotional, always a bit of a choker for me, that one. On \"You Still Believe in Me\", I love that melody - that kills me. That's my favourite, I think, it's so beautiful right at the end comes surging back in these multi-coloured harmonies, sends shivers up my spine.\"Bob Dylan has said of Brian Wilson's talents, \"That ear - I mean, Jesus, he's got to will that to the Smithsonian.\"Roger Waters stated that along with Sgt Pepper, Pet Sounds \"completely changed everything about records for me.\"Elvis Costello stated \"Last summer, I heard \"Don't Talk (Put Your Head On My Shoulder)\" played on the cello. It sounded beautiful and sad, just as it does on Pet Sounds.\"Pete Townshend stated \"'God Only Knows' is simple and elegant and was stunning when it first appeared; it still sounds perfect\".Tom Petty stated \"I think I would put him up there with any composer - especially Pet Sounds.

And I know that some will say that those albums wouldn't have been possible without \"Pet Sounds\", but (to paraphase a Lou Reed lyric), 'what comes is often better than what came before.'While its sonic marvels have dulled over time, \"Pet Sounds\" still boasts some rich melodies and beautiful harmonies, as well as some heartfelt love songs.

I think many critics canonize \"Pet Sounds\" just so they can gleefully (and wrongly) proclaim that there is an album better than those of The Beatles--\"Pet Sounds\" is a good pop album on its own terms, but it is not the 'greatest album of all time' that many believe it to be.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Dated", "unixReviewTime": 1030665600, "reviewTime": "08 30, 2002"}
